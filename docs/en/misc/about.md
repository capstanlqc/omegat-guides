# About

## OmegaT

OmegaT is an open source computer-assisted translation tool (CAT tool) available for all modern desktop operating systems. It has been developed by programmers who translate or translators who program. The program is very efficient for single translators, and with proper configuration and project management can be successfully used in huge translation projects involving multiple translators simultaneously. We at cApStAn love to use OmegaT for our projects because of its flexibility and openness.
