# Delivery

Once you have finished your task in the OmegaT project and have performed the relevant QA checks, you need to deliver the project. The delivery mode will vary depending on whether it's an _offline project_ or a _team project_.

## Online / team project (via repository)

To deliver from a team project: 

  * Go to **Project** > **Commit Target Files**.

That's it! :smile:

## Offline project (via package)

  * Go to **Project** > **Pack project as OMT file...**

    <!-- @todo: update screenshot with current wording -->

  * In the window that pops up, select the location where you want to save the OMT package.
  <!-- @todo: link to http://127.0.0.1:8000/omegat-guides/misc/tips/#file-organization / add 01_Incoming, 02_Work, 03_Outgoing for packages -->
  * Press **Save**
  * Press **OK** in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created.

The folder where exported package is stored will open automatically in your file explorer. 

You will recognize the package because it has the extension `.omt`. That's the file you have to deliver.
