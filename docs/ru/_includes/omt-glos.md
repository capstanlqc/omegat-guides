# Using the glossary

OmegaT supports glossaries. Your project may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself.

!!! success "Help yourself!"
    Adding new term pairs to the glossary might seem like extra work, but if done well it will be of valuable help to insert frequent expressions or to ensure that sensitive terms are translated consistently across the project.
