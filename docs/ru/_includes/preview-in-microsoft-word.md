## Предварительный просмотр в Microsoft Word

When translating coding guides, you cannot preview them on the PISA portal and have to use Microsoft Word to see how they will look like.

To find the translated Word document, go to **Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files**. Откроется окно, в котором будет показано содержимое папки «target». Find the file you were working on and open it with Word.

Go through the Word document to check for any potential issues, but if you find one **make your changes in OmegaT** and not in the Word document itself.
