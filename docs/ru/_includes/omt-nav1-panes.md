## Navigation across panes

When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes:

  * The **Editor** pane is the main pane in which you will be working.
  * Translation suggestions will appear in the **Fuzzy Matches** pane (or just **Matches** pane).
  * The **Glossary** pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add.
  * The **Multiple Translations**  pane will show if a repeated segment has alternative translations.
