## Navigation through segments

In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working on. When you type or insert a translation, it will appear right **below the source text**.

Press ++enter++ on your keyboard to go to the next segment. You can also use ++ctrl+u++ to jump to the next untranslated segment.
A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it, it then becomes green.

In OmegaT, the **color** of the segment's background will help you find your way around between the different segments:

| Color                     | Language | Meaning                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Green**{ .active }      | Source   | active segment (the segment you are working on) |
| **Blue**{ .untranslated } | Source   | untranslated segment                            |
| **Grey**{ .translated }   | Source   | manually translated segment                     |
| **Pink**{ .auto }         | Target   | pretranslated segment                           |
| **Orange**{ .enforce }    | Target   | pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend)   |

<!-- @todo: add pink pretranslate -->

!!! caution
If you want to change a trend translation, document it in the monitoring form but do not try to change it in OmegaT. Any changes you make to these segments will not be saved. The existing translation will be maintained.
