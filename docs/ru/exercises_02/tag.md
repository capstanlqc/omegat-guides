## Exercise 04.1: insert tags

1. Go to segment #10, which is untranslated.

   > Source text reads: `There are no <g1>right</g1> answers.` <!-- segment should be untranslated -->

2. Notice the two tags in the segment.

   > @quiz: what do you think these are? How to we handle them: should we ignore them or reproduce them in the translation? @todo: move to quiz or remove

3. Translate segment #10.

   > Suggested translation: `Il n’y a pas de bonne réponse.`

4. Select the part of the translation that corresponds to "right"

   > Tip: you should select `bonne`

5. Press ++ctrl+space++ to open the auto-completer.
6. Press ++ctrl+space++ several times to cycle through all the sections in the auto-completer. Stop when you reach the “Missing tags” section.
7. The first option (i.e. `<g1>|</g1>`) is selected by default. Press ++enter++ to insert tag pair.
8. Notice how the two paired tags are inserted around the selected text in the translation.

   > Expected result: `Il n’y a pas de <g1>bonne</g1> réponse.`

Well done!


## Exercise 04.2: trigger the tag tooltip

<!-- translation: Le traducteur a dû prêter attention au formatage tel que le gras, l'italique, le soulignement</g3>. -->

1. Press ++ctrl+j++ and enter 55 to go to segment #55.

   > Source text reads: `The translator had to pay attention to formatting such as <g1>bold</g1>, <g2>italics</g2>, <g3>underline</g3>.`

2. Hover over the tags with your mouse to display a tooltip that shows the line code the tags stand for.

   > Tip: the tooltip should display HTML tags `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<span class="underline">` etc.

<!-- @ŧodo: add exercise about notes, add exercise about search hash -->

## Exercise 04.3: see what standalone tags stand for

1. Press ++ctrl+j++ and enter 75 to go to segment #75.

   > Source text reads `if <x1/> sensor detects black`

2. Notice how the segment contains one standalone tag.
3. Hover over the tag to see what the tag stands for.

   > The tooltip should show `{{sensor_type}}`

4. Go to the next segment, #76
5. Notice how this segment has _two_ standalone tags, not two paired tags!
6. Check what the two tags stand for.

   > The tooltips should show `{{object1}}` and `{{object2}}`

!!! warning "Предупреждение"
    The difference between two standalone tags and two paired tags is very important.

## Exercise 04.4: insert standalone tags

1. Go to segment #77.
2. Notice that the tag is missing in the translation.
3. Place the mouse cursor in the position where you would like to insert the tag.

   > Tip: right at the end of the translation

4. Press ++ctrl+space++ to launch the auto-completer and insert the tag.
5. Go to segment #78.
6. Notice how the tag is also missing in this translation.
7. Place the mouse cursor in the position where you would like to insert the tag.

   > Tip: click between `tourner à droite jusqu'à ce que` and `le capteur détecte le noir`

8. Use the auto-completer to insert the missing tag.

## Exercise 04.5: insert standalone tag as you translate

1. Go to segment #79.
2. To translate the segment and insert the tag, proceed in this way:
3. Translate "repeat"

   > Suggested translation of the first part: `répéter`

4. Use the auto-completer to insert the missing tag

   > Remember the shortcut to launche the auto-completer is ++ctrl+space++

5. Translate "times"

   > Suggested translation of the second part: `fois`

You have inserted the tag as you made progress through the translation.

## Exercise 04.6: insert more tags

1. Still in segment #39, notice how most tags are missing in the translation.
2. Select the part of the translation that corresponds to “bold”

   > Tip: `le gras`

3. Press ++ctrl+space++ to open the "Missing tags" section in the auto-completer.
4. The first line (i.e. `<g1></g1>`) is selected by default. Press ++enter++ to insert that tag pair.
4. Notice how the tags have been inserted around the selected text

   > Results should be `<g1>le gras</g1>`

5. Do the same for the translation of “italics”

   > Tip: `l’italique`

5. Do the same for the translation of “underline”

   > Tip: `le soulignement`
