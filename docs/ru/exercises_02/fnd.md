Using the search function, try to find the following segments in the project:

1. Notice that here is one instance of the repeated segment "Rather unsatisfied" that was not translated consistenly.
	
	> @quiz: can you find it?

2. Find the segment with "How" in a note.
3. Try to find the translation of "translator" in the translation memories.
4. Find "Subject", but only if it has a translation.
