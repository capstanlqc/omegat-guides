## Exercise 01.2

<!---Check segment numbers!!-->
<!-- @demo about navigation: explain color green = active segment -->
<!-- @todo (AM): add notice green color to exercise -->

5. Scroll down until you see another untranslated segment in that file.

   > Source text reads: `Generally speaking, please tell me <g1>how satisfied</g1> you are with schools and other educational facilities where you live.`

6. Double click on that segment.

   > You are now on segment #63.

7. Press keyboard shortcut ++ctrl+j++ and enter number 1 to go to segment number #1.


!!! info "Recap"
    In this exercise you have practiced several ways to activate a segment:
    - ++enter++ opens the next segment
    - ++ctrl+enter++ opens the previous segment
    - ++ctrl+u++ opens the next _untranslated_ segment
    - ++ctrl+j++ (plus the segment numberj) opens a specific segment


!!! note "←TODO"
    Check segment numbers after no more changes.
