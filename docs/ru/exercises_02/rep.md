# 05 Repetitions

## Exercise 05.1: notice repeated segments

1. Go to segment #3.

    > Source text reads: `Pretty good`

!!! note inline end "←TODO"
@quiz: how many reps in total?
2. Notice how the segment marker says that this segment is repeated three more times: `<segment 0002 +1 more ¶>`.


3. Look at the **Segment Properties** pane. It says "Is duplicate: FIRST"
4. Right click on the segment. See how all the instances are listed and identified by their segment number.
5. Select `Segment 6` on the list to go to segment #6.
6. Look at the **Segment Properties** pane for segment #6. It says "Is duplicate: NEXT"
    !!! note inline end "←TODO"
    @quiz: some question about FIRST and NEXT (feedback welcome)
7. Right click on segment #6 to see instances listed again, go back to segment #3 again.

## Exercise 05.2: auto-propagate translations

1. Translate segment #2. Suggested translation: "BonNE"

    > -NE ending: feminine suffix, because "Good" here refers to "economic situation", which is feminine in French

2. Press ++enter++ after translating segment #2 to go to segment #3.
3. Notice how the translation is auto-propagated to segment #5.
4. Translate segment #3. Suggested translation: "MauvaisE"

    > -E ending: feminine suffix, because "Bad" here refers to "economic situation", which is feminine in French

5. Press ++enter++ after translating segment #3 to confirm the translation of segment #3 and go to the next segment.
6. Notice how the translation is auto-propagated to segment #6.

## Exercise 05.3: auto-propagate edits in translations

1. Go to segment #5 in the project. You can see that it is translated with your auto-propagated translation.

2. Modify the translation in segment #5 and press ++ctrl+s++ to save the translation.
3. Notice how the translation of segment #2 also changes.

<!-- add link in the guide to the shortcuts page when we mention a shortcut -->

!!! Совет
    Shortcut ++ctrl+s++ saves the translation. You can also save in **Project** > **Save**, but it takes longer ;)
