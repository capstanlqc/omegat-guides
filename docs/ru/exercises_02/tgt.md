# 09. Download git project + commit target files + helpdesk

!!! note "NOTE FOR HELPERS"
    This is a draft.


1. Go to the `C:` drive in your computer and create a new folder called `Work` (or something else if you really dislike "Work" as a folder name).

    | If you don't have permissions to create a folder under `C:`, you can use another location such as `C:\Users\USER\`

2. The path to this folder will be `C:\Work`. This is where you will create your project.


<!-- check what is the path that OmegaT propoess by default -->




<!--Check URL?!-->

1. Copy this URL to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl+C): https://github.com/capstanlqc-pisa/PISA_2025_fr-ZZ_Verification_OMT.git
2. Open OmegaT, click on the Project menu, select "Download Team Project".
3. Click inside the Repository URL field and press Ctrl+V to paste the URL you have copied.
4. Click inside the New Local Project Folder field.
> OmegaT will propose a default path for you, if that path is not suitable you can edit it to have the project created in your preferred location

> **Note**
> We advise you to use an easy path to remember, such as a folder in your Documents folder

5. Press OK, the project will be loaded after a few seconds.
