## Configuration

The OmegaT installation must be configured with some custom files. Please follow the next steps to install or update your configuration.

1. Run OmegaT and go to **Tools** > **Scripting** to open your scripting console, Check whether you have a script called "**Update Customisation Bundle**"

    ![](../_img/custom-script-572-in-scripting-console_Mac.png)

2. If the script "**Update Customisation Bundle**" is there, please click on it to select it and press the **Run** button (at the bottom left) to run it. The script will run to update your config files and will quit OmegaT. 

##### If you don't have the script, here's a fallback plan

If the script is not there, you may download it yourself. See next steps for how to do that.

2. Right-click on the button below and select "Save Link As" to download the configuration script (e.g. to your Desktop)

    [ :material-download: Download UpdateConfigBundle.groovy](https://cat.capstan.be/OmegaT/v572/customization/scripts/updateConfigBundle.groovy){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

3. In OmegaT, follow these steps to run the configuration script you have downloaded:

    - **Tools** > **Scripting** > **File** > **Open script**
    - browse to your Desktop (or the folder where you have saved the script) and select the groovy file
    - press the **Open** button to open the script file and press **Run** button (on the bottom left)

    ![](../_img/omt-open-script-and-run_Mac.gif)

    The script will install the necessary config files, and after that it will quit OmegaT.


You're done now. You can start using OmegaT.
