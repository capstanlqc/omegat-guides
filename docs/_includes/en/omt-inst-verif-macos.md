    <div data-block-type="video" style="width: 480px; height: 304px; left: 400px; top: 326px;" >
        <div class="sl-block-content" style="z-index: 10;" data-media-id="8242392" data-video-thumb="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/videos/1129410/eXYV2O_T/oiepooibjr_thumb_00001.jpg"><video playsinline="" controls="controls" poster="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/videos/1129410/eXYV2O_T/oiepooibjr_thumb_00001.jpg" data-lazy-loaded="" data-paused-by-reveal="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/videos/1129410/eXYV2O_T/oiepooibjr.mp4"></video></div>

    On newer versions of macOS, you may need to control-click (right click) on OmegaT and select **Open**. If it doesn't open, you might need to permit OmegaT to run by clicking on **Open Anyway** next to OmegaT in **System Settings** > **Privacy and Security** > **Security**.

    !!! info "Self-signing in macOS Sequoia 15.1"
        As of macOS Sequoia 15.1, it may be impossible to run OmegaT even with right clicking on the app and selecting **Open**. This might change in the future, but currently to work around that problem one needs to self-sign the downloaded application. Here are the steps to do that:
        
        * Open **Keychain Access** on your Mac. If you can't find **Keychain Access**, navigate to `/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications` in Finder, and open `Keychain Access.app`.
            
        * From the **Keychain Access** menu, go to **Certificate Assistant** > **Create a Certificate**.
        
        * Name your certificate (e.g., `My App Signing Cert`), set the **Identity Type** to **Self-Signed Root**, and the **Certificate Type** to **Code Signing**.
        
        * Save the certificate in the **login** keychain.
        
        * Run the `codesign` command in your **Terminal** to sign **OmegaT.app** with the certificate you created. The basic command looks like this:
        ```bash
        codesign --deep --force --verify --verbose --sign "My App Signing Cert" /Applications/OmegaT.app
        ```  
        If you gave your certificate a different name and/or copied **OmegaT.app** to a different location, change the above command accordingly.

## Setup checks

If you want to run a post-installation check to confirm that you have the correct version, you can check that in **Help** > **About** > **Copy Support Info**. You should see:

    Version: OmegaT-5.7.3_0_57b1bb571
    Platform: Windows 10 10.0
    Java: 11.0.19 amd64


## Configuration

The OmegaT installation must be configured with some custom files. Please follow the next steps to install or update your configuration.

1. Run OmegaT and go to **Tools** > **Scripting** to open your scripting console, Check whether you have a script called "**Update Customisation Bundle**"

    ![](../_img/custom-script-572-in-scripting-console_Mac.png)

2. If the script "**Update Customisation Bundle**" is there, please click on it to select it and press the **Run** button (at the bottom left) to run it. The script will run to update your config files and will quit OmegaT. 

##### If you don't have the script, here's a fallback plan

If the script is not there, you may download it yourself. See next steps for how to do that.

2. Right-click on the button below and select "Save Link As" to download the configuration script (e.g. to your Desktop)

    [ :material-download: Download UpdateConfigBundle.groovy](https://cat.capstan.be/OmegaT/v572/customization/scripts/updateConfigBundle.groovy){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

3. In OmegaT, follow these steps to run the configuration script you have downloaded:

    - **Tools** > **Scripting** > **File** > **Open script**
    - browse to your Desktop (or the folder where you have saved the script) and select the groovy file
    - press the **Open** button to open the script file and press **Run** button (on the bottom left)

    ![](../_img/omt-open-script-and-run_Mac.gif)

    The script will install the necessary config files, and after that it will quit OmegaT.


You're done now. You can start using OmegaT.
