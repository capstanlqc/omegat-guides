## Inserting special characters

You may need to type special characters such as:

  * quotation marks: `«»`, `„“`, `‘’`, etc. 
  * mathematical symbols: `×`, `π`, `÷`, `≤`, `≠`, `√`, etc. 
  * superindex or subindex numbers or letters: `₂`, `²`, `³`, etc.
  * other characters: `®`, `™`, etc.

### Character table

We have put the most frequent special characters in the **Character Table**. To insert a special character from the **Character Table**, follow these steps:

  * Press ++ctrl+space++ on your keyboard several times until you reach the **Character Table**.

### Autotext

Alternatively, you may use **Autotext** entries to insert a special character by typing a shortcut. You can see the list of available shortcuts [here](../misc/autotext.md){:target="_blank"}.

Let's see some examples: 

+ For example, to write the abbreviation of square meters ("m²"), you can type shortcut `\sup2` to insert superindex character `²`. 

+ Another example: in chemical formulas, the number of atoms is often noted with a subindex number, e.g. "CO₂". To insert character `₂`, type shortcut `\sub2`.

+ In order to insert a non-breaking space, type `\nbsp`: the auto-completer will propose to insert the character from the autotext list.
