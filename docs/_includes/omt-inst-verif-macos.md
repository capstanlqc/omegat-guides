# OmegaT 5.7.2 setup guide for macOS


Carefully choose your path here:

- If there is no current installation of OmegaT in your machine, you can skip the following steps about configuration and jump directly to the [installation section](#installation). OmegaT will configure itself as part of the installation.
- If you already have a previous version (e.g. 5.7.1 or 4.2.0) of OmegaT installed, you'll have to update your configuration first: to do so please go to the [configuration section](#configuration) (next section right down below).

##  Configuration

This section applies to users that already have a previous version (e.g. 5.7.1 or 4.2.0) of OmegaT installed. Please follow the next steps to update your configuration for starteers.

1. Run OmegaT and go to **Tools** > **Scripting** to open your scripting console,  In OmegaT 5.7.1, please open the scripting console. Check whethers you have a script called "**Update Customisation Bundle (v572)**":

    !!! warning 
        If you don't see the "**v752**" bit, then it's not the script we're looking for. See next step to fetch the script.

    If the script "**Update Customisation Bundle (v572)**" is there, please click on it to select it and press the **Run** button (at the bottom left) to run it. The script will run to update your config files and will quit OmegaT. After that, skip the next step and jump directly to the [installation section](#installation).

    If the script is not there, go to the next step to download it.

2. Click on the button below to download the configuration script (e.g. to your Desktop)

    [ :material-download: Download UpdateConfigBundle.groovy](https://cat.capstan.be/OmegaT/v572/customization/scripts/updateConfigBundle.groovy){ .md-button .md-button--primary }


<!-- [file.ext](../static/file.ext){:download} -->

3. In OmegaT, follow these steps to run the configuration script you have downloaded:
	- **Tools** > **Scripting** > **File** > **Open script**
	- browse to your Desktop (or the folder where you have saved the script) and select the groovy file
	- press the **Open** button to open the script file and press **Run** button (on the bottom left)
