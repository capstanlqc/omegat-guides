1. Go to the `C:` drive in your computer and create a new folder called `Work` (or something else if you really dislike "Work" as a folder name).

	| If you don't have permissions to create a folder under `C:`, you can use another location such as `C:\Users\USER\`

2. The path to this folder will be `C:\Work`. This is where you will create your project.


<!-- check what is the path that OmegaT propoess by default -->




<!--Check URL?!-->

1. Copy this URL to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl+C): https://github.com/capstanlqc-pisa/PISA_2025_fr-ZZ_Verification_OMT.git
2. Open OmegaT, click on the Project menu, select "Download Team Project".
3. Click inside the Repository URL field and press Ctrl+V to paste the URL you have copied.
4. Click inside the New Local Project Folder field.
>OmegaT will propose a default path for you, if that path is not suitable you can edit it to have the project created in your preferred location

5. Press OK, the project will be loaded after a few seconds.
