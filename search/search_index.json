To insert the active match in full, press Ctrl + I on your keyboard. After inserting it, make any necessary changes so that it fits the segment you are reconciling. Alternatively, you can also insert only part of a match or combine several matches: Double-click the match you want use to activate it Drag your mouse over the part of the match you wish to insert to select it Press Ctrl + I on your keyboard to insert it Select (part of) another match if appropriate or type the rest of the translation Remember It is important to make sure the final translation is harmonized as the two translators may use different terms and styles. To ensure this, make sure you preview the item prior to delivery and perform concordance searches on recurring instructions and terminology.","title":"Reconciling using matches"},{"location":"_includes/omt-rec-other/","text":"Other useful features \u00b6 Inserting source segment in target \u00b6 In some cases, the translation must be identical to the source text.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://some-bar-domain.com/some/path/to/the/foo-repository.git . To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. Let's assume it's C:/Work/ (but please use whatever path is appropriate on your end). Copy the URL of the project repository. In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. To do that: Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. C:/Work/ . Then, in the New Local Project Folder field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. Then, press Ctrl + V to paste your path in replacemenet of the deleted part. Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear. You can open a project that already exists only after you have already unpacked it or downloaded it. In turn, you only download or unpack a project that doesn't exist yet in your machine.","title":"Accessing the project"},{"location":"_includes/omt-unpack-and-recent/#accessing-the-project","text":"Tip Please give some thought to the organization of your files and folders before you proceed with the steps below.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://some-bar-domain.com/some/path/to/the/foo-repository.git . To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. Let's assume it's C:/Work/ (but please use whatever path is appropriate on your end). Copy the URL of the project repository. In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. To do that: Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. C:/Work/ . Then, in the New Local Project Folder field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. Then, press Ctrl + V to paste your path in replacemenet of the deleted part. Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear. You can open a project that already exists only after you have already unpacked it or downloaded it.

That applies to text in any language except languages written in a right-to-left (RTL) script, like Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, etc., in which case the segment flows from right to left (RTL) and is aligned to the right. Global text direction and alignment of source and target segments is determined by the source and target languages, respectively, indicated in the project settings. Depending on the language, segments are aligned either to the left or to the right. On the other hand, while text direction at the segment level is determined by the project settings, text direction might change inside the segment depending on the script used. For example, English text in a LTR segment will flow left to right but a quotation in Arabic in that same segment will flow right to left. Since OmegaT users are only responsible for producing the translation, let\u2019s focus on what happens in target segments. Everything that follows applies to source segments too, with the difference that they are not directly editable in the translation editor in OmegaT. Bidirectionality mode \u00b6 The bidirectionality mode activates either when at least one of the two languages in the project uses a RTL script or when some text in a RTL is inserted. When the bidirectionality mode is activated, text direction is indicated by a flag on the top of the cursor. In the image below, notice how by default the cursor flag points left in a RTL segment but it may point left or right depending on the previous character: In text written in an LTR script, text flows from left to right, which means that the cursor flag points right and every character typed in LTR script always appears to the right of the previous one. That is always the case for the whole LTR segment unless it contains some fragment in an RTL script, in which case the rules for RTL text apply within that fragment. Strong and weak directionality \u00b6 In text written in an RTL script, text flows from right to left or left to right depending on the characters typed. Alphabetic characters have a RTL directionality: after each alphabetical character, the cursor flag points left, which means that if a new character is inserted, it will appear to the left of the cursor. On the other hand, numeric characters have a LTR directionality: after each number, the cursor flag points right, which means that if a new number is inserted, it will appear to the right of the cursor. Strings in LTR script will behave like numbers. Letters and numbers have a strong directionality, which means that they always flow in the same direction: letters in RTL script flow from right to left, letters in LTR flow from left to right, and numbers in any script always flow from left to right too. However, other characters like punctuation symbols do not have an intrinsic directionality of their own and will inherit the directionality of the segment (hence called of weak or neutral directionality): one same character (e.g. +, as in the image above) will flow right to left in a RTL segment, whereas it will flow left to right in a LTR segment. Orientation \u00b6 Some characters, such as quotation marks, are purely bidirectional and may also have a different orientation depending on the directionality of the segment. For example, the opening double angle quotation mark (Unicode U+00AB) points left when used in a LTR segment, but the same character points right when used in a RTL segment. In the image below, an autotext entry is used to insert that character in an LTR segment: In the image below, in turn, the same autotext entry is used to insert the same character in a LTR segment: The same thing would happen with any other double characters with neutral directionality, such as parenthesis, square brackets, curly brackets, etc. The opening character will point left or right depending on the directionality of the text stretch where it is inserted. Bidirectionality control characters \u00b6 Often the default behaviour described above is fine, but when you\u2019re mixing RTL text and LTR text or using special characters with weak directionality in RTL, you might need to use Unicode bidirectionality control characters (or bidi characters for short) to achieve the expected directionality. Bidi control characters can be found in the menu Edit > Insert Unicode Control Characters and may be used to: insert an invisible character with a certain strong directionality to force a specific position for a character with weak directionality create an embedding which works as a sort of protective environment within which text can flow in the opposite direction of the segment. These control characters are invisible, nothing is display or printed, but they change directionality. If you want to see where these characters are inserted, you can activate option View > Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters . Marks \u00b6 Let\u2019s see a few examples. Some expressions and brand names combine symbols with letters, e.g. Yahoo!, C++, C#, Hola!, Chips Ahoy!, etc. If you must write, say, \u201cC++\u201d in Arabic, you will notice that by default the + characters will appear to the left of the letter C: That is obviously incorrect. To force the correct position of the ++ characters, type C, then ++, then insert a left-to-right mark (or LRM for short) at the end. The ++ part will then be surrounded by two characters with strong LTR directionality (namely, the letter C and the LRM) and therefore will inherit the directionality of those characters and flow left to right instead of inheriting the directionality of the segment and flow right to left. See that in action in the following image: You might be tempted to type characters in reverse order: first ++, then C. Even though that might look good, that is logically wrong and could bring about issues when the text is further processed later or subjected to different uses. For example, if you type ++C in Arabic, even if it looks visually correct in the translation editor, it will not appear in search results when a user looks for \u201cC++\u201d in the Arabic document. Let alone the fact that often, if the expression is a bit complex, you\u2019ll struggle with trial and error until you obtain something that (only) looks as expected (although underneath it is wrong). Don\u2019t try to fake the looks. LRM and RLM (marks) characters are enough when you must change the directionality and position of one character only at the end or beginning of one homogeneous chunk of text. However, when the expression that must flow in the opposite direction contains several parts separated by spaces, or contains non-alphanumeric characters as well as alphanumeric characters, it\u2019s often better to use RTL or LTR embeddings. Embeddings \u00b6 The behaviour of embeddings is a bit different from that of marks. For starters, two characters must be inserted: one to start the embedding and another one to pop out of it. For example, to create a LTR embedding in an RTL segment, you would insert a left-to-right embedding (LRE) character, then the LTR text, then the pop directional formatting (PDF) character. Likewise, to create a RTL embedding in an LTR segment, you would insert a right-to-left embedding (RLE) character, then the RTL text, then the PDF character. Let\u2019s see an example. Equations, formulas and mathematical notation in general are expressions that must normally run left-to-right in bidirectional languages like Arabic or Hebrew, just like in English. Simply typing or copy-pasting an equation in Arabic will not produce the correct result, as can be seen in the image below: Instead, you should proceed in this way to create a LTR embedding: insert the LRE character, then type or insert the equation, finally insert the PDF character. See that in action: Notice how the red square rim appears around the LTR embedding right after inserting the PDF character, when the option Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters is activated in the View menu.","title":"Bidirectionality"},{"location":"misc/bidi/#text-direction-and-text-alignment","text":"By default, text direction in the translation editor is left to right (LTR) and text is aligned to the left.

This has not impact on the actual font size in the target files. It only changes the display in OmegaT. How do I install the spellchecker files? \u00b6 A spellchecker is available in OmegaT. Go to Options > Preferences > Spellchecker. Click on Install new dictionary and choose the spellchecker for your language. You should see the URL [https://cat.capstan.be/OmegaT/hunspell/](https://cat.capstan.be/OmegaT/hunspell/) . A list of languages will open. Select the appropriate language for your country and press OK (e.g. es_AR - Spanish (Argentina) if your language is Spanish and your country is Argentina). Press the Install button. You can close the remaining pop up window. The spellchecker is now installed. There is no spellchecker for my language. What should I do ? \u00b6 If you cannot find your language in the list when you go to Options>Preferences>Spellchecker. and then clicking on Install new dictionary , please contact the helpdesk and our team will try to find a spellchecker for you. Please note that we may not be able to find a spellchecker for all languages. What should I do if I don't have the Import OMT Package feature within the Project menu? \u00b6 If you do not see the Import OMT Package option in the Project menu, please download and run the customizer again: . If you still cannot see the Import OMT Package option, please contact the Helpdesk. When I translate, I like to overwrite the source text with the target. Can I insert the source text in the target segment automatically and then start translating? \u00b6 The answer is yes. To do so, go to Options>Editor in OmegaT. Then tick the option \"Insert the source text\" and press OK. In OmegaT, when you navigate from one segment to another, the source text will be automatically inserted each time. I made a mistake in a term I added to the glossary. Can I correct it? \u00b6 The answer is yes. To access the glossary, go to Project>Access Project contents>Glossaries The Glossaries folder will open. It context a .txt file named \"glossary.txt\". Double click on it to open it in your text editor. Correct any term that contains an error and Save the file. As an NPM, how can I send the files to my translation team? \u00b6 Please do NOT send them by e-mail. You should find a password protected, secure channel (e.g. Google Drive or Dropbox is at least accepted for PIAAC as long as the folders are password protected and the users need to insert a password when connecting, it's ok). Do we have access to the translation memories from the previous cycle if we already took part in the project? \u00b6 The answer is yes. You can access it in two different ways: from OmegaT: the translation memory per domain from the previous cycle is included as reference in the OmegaT packages. from which contains translations from all previous cycles of the project for your language. Is it possible to access MemoryLn with a translator account? \u00b6 The answer is yes. MemoryLn can be accessed by logging in to the portal. If you have portal credentials you can access MemoryLn for your language by default, independently of the role you have in the project. Can I export the XLIFFs and work in Trados or another CAT tool? \u00b6 The answer is no. OmegaT was specifically customized to edit the files you are working on. Such a customization is not possible in Trados or memoQ. Removing the files from the OMT package and translating them separately may damage the files and render them unusable on the portal. In omegaT is it possible to search for translation by the target? Or it\u2019s only possible by source? \u00b6 The answer is yes. Press Ctrl + F on your keyboard (without selecting anything in the source segment). The search window opens. Type the text in your language you are searching for and press the** Search** button. When I reconcile I only see suggestions from translator 1 for certain segments. Is it normal? \u00b6 The answer is yes. When you only see 1 suggestion in the fuzzy matches pane, it means the two translators have proposed the exact same translation. Next to the fuzzy match from translator 1 you will also notice it is written +1 more. Why is my OMT package rejected in the portal and how I can fix it? \u00b6 It is required that all segments are translated at the end of both translation and reconciliation tasks. To ensure this is the case, uploaded projects are checked for completion in every workflow step when you try to finish the task. If it is detected that some segments are not translated in the project, it is not possible to finish the task. How do you know whether all segments are translated in your project? You can go to Tools > Statistics to obtain a report of the project statistics. If the \"Remaining\" or \"Unique remaining\" rows do not show \"0\", that means that some segments are not translated. Also, if you press shortcut Ctrl + U , OmegaT will open the next untranslated segment. How can you fix this? You guessed it! Translate all remaining segments, then export the OMT package again, upload it again and then try to finis the task again.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"misc/faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"misc/faq/#can-i-export-the-contents-of-the-omegat-project-in-excel","text":"Yes.

OmegaT will be installed from a designated installer that will be downloaded from the http://omegat.org website. The customization consists of editing or adding some settings files to the default installation and an executable developed by cApStAn will be provided to users to save them the effort of doing the customization manually. If you prefer to customize manually, that's also possible, just let us know. The purpose of the present document is to provide information relevant for IT departments who must ensure that any software installed in their organization does not pose any security threads. Updating Windows malware definitions \u00b6 Before downloading the installation files (OmegaT installer and customization utility), you should update Windows Defender's definitions. On the command prompt as administrator: Change directory to C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender Run MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures Run MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate Source: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions Integrity verification <= UPDATE NEEDED \u00b6 You can check the integrity of the file to make sure that, after download, you have the same file that is available for download in the repository of OmegaT binaries. On Windows, you can compute the cryptographic hash values of a binary file with the File Checksum Integrity Verifier utility (check this for further information and download the utility). The correct hashes of the 64-bit installer (OmegaT_4.1.5_04_Beta_Windows_64.exe) are: SHA1: 9a7560368ca11255c4359c2ed225eb0bd7a7fbe0 MD5: 8c4dd481b715396979ba6ec5e2d1e9a8 The correct hashes of the 32-bit installer (OmegaT_4.1.5_04_Beta_Windows.exe) are: SHA1: 682e38f718ef8736ccb978f45dd13da75184648a MD5: 608417d270bc67f153d92e243abd1f96 These values are taken from the official OmegaT download page . If you obtain the same values, you can be certain that you have the same file as it\u2019s available for download and that it\u2019s safe to whitelist it. Java maintenance \u00b6 OmegaT is developed in Java and needs JRE to run. The OmegaT installers we recommend include the version of JRE that OmegaT needs, and that JRE would be uninstalled when OmegaT is uninstalled. However, in any case, as Java can be a security risk if it\u2019s not kept up to date, it\u2019s worth maintaining that version of JRE up to date after installed if necessary. Data leakage \u00b6 OmegaT can check for new versions, get MT results, get glossary matches from TaaS, download MediaWiki links and use them as source files, have remote files on HTTP, Git and SVN servers mapped locally, and then there's SVN/Git team project functionality. We're not using any of those functions in the translation of the PISA/PIAAC materials, which means we won't instruct users to configure or use them. However, it\u2019s always possible that the user unilaterally uses them. If this is a concern for the organization, OmegaT could be made to work in a complete offline manner, namely it could be started with a non-functional proxy, so it won't connect to internet at all (specifying a non-existing proxy server, e.g. 270.270, in the startup parameters in the OmegaT.l4J.ini file). In other words, it\u2019s up to the organization and their internal policy to decide how much access to the internet it must be allowed to OmegaT. Open source \u00b6 In case of any concerns about vulnerabilities in OmegaT against viruses or other malware, the source code is freely available and used to build software packages in several OS distributions. Any Java engineer can inspect the code and conduct any tests to assess its robustness and reliability. Endorsement by big organizations \u00b6 The European Commission has been promoting the use of open-source software namely within its [R&D programmes]. It is in this context that open source applications like OmegaT are being used in DGT (the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Translation), alongside other commercial applications. DGT has been using OmegaT for prototyping since 2012, customizing it and extending it with some useful improvements. This information can be useful to endorse the usage of OmegaT.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://some-bar-domain.com/some/path/to/the/foo-repository.git . To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. Let's assume it's C:/Work/ (but please use whatever path is appropriate on your end). Copy the URL of the project repository. In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. To do that: Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. C:/Work/ . Then, in the New Local Project Folder field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. Then, press Ctrl + V to paste your path in replacemenet of the deleted part. Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear. You can open a project that already exists only after you have already unpacked it or downloaded it. In turn, you only download or unpack a project that doesn't exist yet in your machine.*[TM]: translation memory","title":"Accessing the project"},{"location":"proofreading/accessing-the-project/#accessing-the-project","text":"Tip Please give some thought to the organization of your files and folders before you proceed with the steps below.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://some-bar-domain.com/some/path/to/the/foo-repository.git . To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. Let's assume it's C:/Work/ (but please use whatever path is appropriate on your end). Copy the URL of the project repository. In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. To do that: Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. C:/Work/ . Then, in the New Local Project Folder field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. Then, press Ctrl + V to paste your path in replacemenet of the deleted part. Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ).

You can see the list of available shortcuts here . Let's see some examples: For example, to write the abbreviation of square meters (\"m\u00b2\"), you can type shortcut \\sup2 to insert superindex character \u00b2 . Another example: in chemical formulas, the number of atoms is often noted with a subindex number, e.g. \"CO\u2082\". To insert character \u2082 , type shortcut \\sub2 . In order to insert a non-breaking space, type \\nbsp : the auto-completer will propose to insert the character from the autotext list.

The software has been customized to enable you to perform your task. Quick walkthrough \u00b6 Download the package for adaptation and the Excel document from the portal Import the OMT package in OmegaT as described in the section The OmegaT project for adaptation will open: If you're borrowing another translation, all segments will probably appear translated in the Editor pane (the main pane of OmegaT, which contains the source text and the translation). If you are adapting from a base version (your target version is a variation of the source version), you might find it useful to automatically insert the source text in every segment . You can distinguish trend segments from non-trend segments thanks to a color coding: trend segments appear highlighted in orange. For more information about navigation between segments, please refer to the section of this user guide. If you adapt any recurring term or recurring instructions in a file, please make sure that the adaptation is done consistently. You can perform a concordance search on a specific term or phrase and OmegaT will display all segments containing it. You can go through the results to make sure that everything has been adapted consistently. For more information about concordance searches, please check the section Concordance search Installation and setup \u00b6 To install OmegaT on a computer running on Windows, please consult the . Accessing the package \u00b6 Accessing the package for the first time \u00b6 The following steps need to be performed only once per OmegaT package : when you access each package for the first time: Download the from the portal Store the in a location you will remember on your computer. Import the in OmegaT: Open OmegaT Go to Project>Import OMT package Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Choose the and click on Open A pop up opens. Click Yes . Translate/Reconcile/Adapt/Review the files in the package. When you are done working for the day, close OmegaT. Access the package after import \u00b6 The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project>Open Recent Project . The project you were working on is the first one in the list: Navigation \u00b6 Navigation between the different panes \u00b6 When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes: The Editor pane is the main pane in which you will be working. Translation suggestions will appear in the Fuzzy Matches pane . The Glossary pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add. The Multiple Translations pane will show you if a repeated segment was translated differently. Navigation between the different files \u00b6 If the project contains multiple files, they are listed in the Project Files pane . The file currently open is highlighted in blue. If you want to open a different file in the Editor pane, click on it in the Project Files pane. You can also see the name of the file that is open in the Editor pane's title bar. Navigation between the different segments \u00b6 In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working in. When a translation is inserted, it will appear below the source text. Press the Enter key on your keyboard to go to the next segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it. It then becomes green. In OmegaT, a color code will help you find your way around between the different segments: Green = the segment you are working in (active segment) Grey = translated segment. The translation is displayed below the source text. Orange = pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend). If you want to make a change to a trend segment, document it in the monitoring document but do not try to change it in OmegaT. Any changes you make to these segments will not be saved. The existing translation will be maintained. All segments should appear translated in a project for adaptation either in gray or in orange (trend) and the translation should be displayed below the source. If you notice an untranslated segment in * *, please provide a translation and document it in the monitoring document. Handling tags ( Ctrl + T ) \u00b6 Recognizing tags \u00b6 If you are in a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags - standalone tags and double tags: Standalone tags = a single tag with a precise role (e.g. tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Double tags are composed of an opening and a closing tag, such as the HTML tags for making text bold, italic, underlined, etc. Double tags affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the source and in the translation. Fixing tag issues \u00b6 For your language task, all tags should be present in the translation. What is important is to correct potential errors that you may see. In the screenshot below, in the source segment the **** are around the letter \"n\" while in the target they are around the word \"which\" . To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps: double click on the first incorrectly inserted tag in the target segment to select it and press Backspace on your keyboard to delete it repeat the operation until you deleted all incorrectly inserted tags place your mouse where the first tag should be correctly inserted and press Ctrl + T on your keyboard to insert the first tag insert all other missing tags. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. Most common HTML tags \u00b6 Below you will find the most common HTML tags you may encounter. Using Fuzzy matches ( Ctrl + I ) \u00b6 Any changes you make during adaptation are saved in the translation memory of the project. When you activate a segment which is similar to one you have already adapted, you may see suggestions in the fuzzy matches pane. The source in the fuzzy matches pane shows the difference between the active segment and the previous translation in \u201ctrack changes\u201d mode like in Word: Parts that do not appear in the active segment are in ~~~~ Parts that are added are in ____ Do not hesitate to consult the fuzzy matches pane to ensure you make the same changes consistently throughout. You can insert a fuzzy match or a part of a fuzzy match with Ctrl + I : Activate the fuzzy match you wish to use by double clicking on it. With your mouse, select the part you wish to insert. Press Ctrl + I on your keyboard to insert it. Do not forget to delete all unnecessary/remaining text from the target segment to ensure everything is correct. Using the Glossary \u00b6 OmegaT supports glossaries. Your package may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself. Inserting glossary terms \u00b6 When you arrive in an active segment which contains a glossary term, the respective term is underlined in blue in the source segment. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane , on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding terms to the glossary \u00b6 If in the project you are working on you keep adapting the same term over and over you may wish to add it to the glossary to ensure you adapt consistently throughout. In the active segment,** select the term** you want to insert with your mouse Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu A pop-up window will open Enter the Target term and press the OK button. Handling repeated segments \u00b6 Some segments are identical to each other. They are called \u201c repeated segments \u201d and their translation is autopropagated . Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because it has gray font. When a repeated segment is active, the segment number will indicate how many repetitions exist: If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will point out the other occurrences of a repeated segment. It can be useful to jump to them (by selecting them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which a repeated segment appears. Autopropagation \u00b6 If you edit the translation of a repeated segment, by default, the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions. This happens in the same file, but also in all the files of the OmegaT package. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, you may not wish to modify the translation of all repeated segments. Due to a different context, you may need to change only ONE of the repeated segments: Right click on the segment Choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu Change the translation of your active segment and then either press Ctrl + S or move to the next one. If you return on the repeated segment, you will see the different translations appear in the Multiple Translations pane. Other useful features \u00b6 Using the character table \u00b6 Special characters can be inserted with the Special Characters Table. Special characters can be: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb, \u201e\u201c, \u2018\u2019, etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7, \u03c0, \u00f7, \u2264, \u2260, \u221a, etc. other characters: \u00ae, \u2122 When you arrive in a segment in which you need to insert a special character, perform the following steps: Press Ctrl + Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the special characters table. Select the character you want to insert Press Enter and continue editing your segment. Inserting non-breaking spaces \u00b6 In order to insert non-breaking spaces in OmegaT, please make sure you have installed Auto Hot Key . If you haven't installed it yet, please check the Third Party Tools section of the OmegaT Installation guide Once Auto Hot Key is installed, you can insert non-breaking spaces with the same keyboard shortcut as in Word: Ctrl + Shift + Space . You can recognize a non breaking space because it is gray. Performing concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to look for words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word you want to search for with your mouse. Press Ctrl + F on your keyboard. The Search window will open. Press Search. The results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl + C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the target translation at the right place. TIP: There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. Performing QA checks in OmegaT \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments of the OmegaT package must have a translation. To ensure that is the case, please check for completion prior to delivery: Go to Project>Project Files The project files pane will open OK: If the Number of unique segments is equal to the number of Translated unique segments . NOT OK : the Number of unique segments is different from the number of Translated unique segments . To correct: Close the Project Files Pane Press Ctrl + U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . When the cursor stops moving from the active segment then all segments have a translation. Recheck for completion, to make sure by opening the Project Files pane. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools>Check Issues . A pop up window will open. By default, other types of checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) are ticked. If you want to check for issues related to tags before performing the rest of the checks, you can untick them. You will notice that the Tag Issues box cannot be unticked. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one: Correct the issue by clicking on Jump to Segment . You will arrive at the appropriate segment in the editor pane. Place your cursor where the missing tag needs to be inserted and press Ctrl + T to insert the missing tag. Press Enter to move to the next segment. Open the Error report again. It has automatically refreshed. Finish going through the issues. TIP : If in the source there are tags that you do not use in your language which are present in the source segment, to avoid having false positives in the error report, you can insert them at the end of the segment. They would not have an impact on any text. Caution Please do not click on \"Apply fix\", fix each issue manually. Glossary adherence check \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools>Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press** OK.** An error report will open Go through the issues one by one and jump to segment to correct the eventual error if needed. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl + Shift + D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your changes. To access the file, go to Project>Access Project Contents>Target Files . A window with the contents of the \"target\" folder will open. Find the file you were working on, if there are several files and preview it to read the translation in context. Delivering the project \u00b6 Once you have finished editing the OmegaT package and have performed the appropriate Q&A checks, you need to Export the .

The software has been customized to optimize your task. Installation and setup \u00b6 To install and customize OmegaT on a computer running Windows, please follow these steps: If you use Mac or Linux, please get in touch with our Helpdesk. Accessing the project \u00b6 Tip Please give some thought to the organization of your files and folders before you proceed with the steps below. We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://some-bar-domain.com/some/path/to/the/foo-repository.git . To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. Let's assume it's C:/Work/ (but please use whatever path is appropriate on your end). Copy the URL of the project repository. In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. To do that: Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. C:/Work/ . Then, in the New Local Project Folder field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. Then, press Ctrl + V to paste your path in replacemenet of the deleted part. Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear. You can open a project that already exists only after you have already unpacked it or downloaded it. In turn, you only download or unpack a project that doesn't exist yet in your machine. Navigation \u00b6 Navigation across panes \u00b6 When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes: The Editor pane is the main pane in which you will be working. Translation suggestions will appear in the Fuzzy Matches pane (or just Matches pane). The Glossary pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add. The Multiple Translations pane will show if a repeated segment has alternative translations. Navigation through files \u00b6 If the project contains multiple files, they are listed in the Project Files window. The file currently open is highlighted in blue. If you want to open a different file in the Editor pane, click on it in the Project Files window. You can also see the name of the file that is open in the Editor pane's title bar. The following video shows navigation through files: Navigation through segments \u00b6 In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working on. When you type or insert a translation, it will appear right below the source text . Press Enter on your keyboard to go to the next segment. You can also use Ctrl + U to jump to the next untranslated segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it, it then becomes green. In OmegaT, the color of the segment's background will help you find your way around between the different segments: Color Language Meaning Green Source active segment (the segment you are working on) Blue Source untranslated segment Grey Source manually translated segment Pink Target pretranslated segment Orange Target pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend) Caution If you want to change a trend translation, document it in the monitoring form but do not try to change it in OmegaT. Any changes you make to these segments will not be saved. The existing translation will be maintained. The following video shows navigation through segments, enjoy : Reconciling using matches \u00b6 During the reconciliation task, the translations from translator 1 and translator 2 are handled as matches and are displayed in the Matches pane. A reconciler's task in practice consists of one of these three options: Inserting one of the two matches (and then modify it if needed), OR Inserting part of one of the two matches and then inserting part of the other match, OR Translating the segment from scratch if none of the two matches is suitable. By default, the match from translator 1 is activated. It is the first one in the list and it is bolded . If you want to use the match from translator 2, double click on it to activate that one instead (the activated match will become bolded ). To insert the active match in full, press Ctrl + I on your keyboard. After inserting it, make any necessary changes so that it fits the segment you are reconciling. Alternatively, you can also insert only part of a match or combine several matches: Double-click the match you want use to activate it Drag your mouse over the part of the match you wish to insert to select it Press Ctrl + I on your keyboard to insert it Select (part of) another match if appropriate or type the rest of the translation Remember It is important to make sure the final translation is harmonized as the two translators may use different terms and styles. To ensure this, make sure you preview the item prior to delivery and perform concordance searches on recurring instructions and terminology. Handling tags \u00b6 Recognizing tags \u00b6 If a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags: standalone tags and paired tags or double tags: Standalone tags : a single tag with a precise role (e.g. <x1/> tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g1> and </g1> ) and affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the translation as in the source text. Inserting tags \u00b6 To insert tags in your translation, you should use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + T , which inserts the next missing tag. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. If you need to insert tags in a different order than in the source, we advise you to translate the entire segment, place your cursor where the first tag has to be inserted and press Ctrl + T , then repeat the operation until all tags have been inserted. If you have inserted a tag incorrectly and need to delete it, select the tag in full (you can double click on it) and press backspace or delete on your keyboard. @WIP: Basically: before inserting a tag you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags. if standalone: click on the position where you want to insert the tag if paired: select... etc. then, fixing: remove and insert again, or drag and drop Fixing tag issues \u00b6 All tags you see in the source text should be present in the translation too. You must correct any errors that you may see when that's not the case. In the screenshot below, in the source segment the paired tags <i> and </i> are around the letter n while in the target they are around the word which . To correct this issue, you would have to perform the following steps: Double click on the each incorrectly inserted tag in the translation to select it and press Backspace or Del on your keyboard to delete it Select the text that must encompassed by the paired tags. Press Ctrl + Space to launch the auto-completer. You might need to press Ctrl + Space several times to cycle through the different options until you see the list of tags. Select the paired tags that you want to insert and press Enter . The tags are inserted around the text you have selected. Using the glossary \u00b6 OmegaT supports glossaries. Your project may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself. Help yourself! Adding new term pairs to the glossary might seem like extra work, but if done well it will be of valuable help to insert frequent expressions or to ensure that sensitive terms are translated consistently across the project. Inserting terms from the glossary \u00b6 When the active segment contains a source term that is in the glossary, it is underlined in blue in the source text. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane, on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding new entries to the glossary \u00b6 Tip Feeding the glossary with technical or sensitive wording or terms or expressions that appear frequently can be very useful to speed up typing, to keep consistency, to avoid typos, etc.. To add a new term entry to the glossary: In the active segment, drag your mouse over the term you want to insert to select it . Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu. In the Create Glossary Entry that will pop up, enter the target term (and any comments you want). Press the OK button to save the new entry. Handling repetitions \u00b6 Some segments may be repeated in the project. By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be a bit treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you grasp and follow the three steps above to the letter and you should be fine. Other useful features \u00b6 Inserting source segment in target \u00b6 In some cases, the translation must be identical to the source text. To copy the source text in the translation, press Ctrl + Shift + S on your keyboard. Of course, you may also copy-paste the source text in the translation if you prefer. Creating an empty translation \u00b6 All segments must have a translation, even if it's an empty translation. If you want to produce an empty translation, simply press the space bar in your keyboard to insert a space as the translation. Inserting special characters \u00b6 You may need to type special characters such as: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb , \u201e\u201c , \u2018\u2019 , etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7 , \u03c0 , \u00f7 , \u2264 , \u2260 , \u221a , etc. superindex or subindex numbers or letters: \u2082 , \u00b2 , \u00b3 , etc. other characters: \u00ae , \u2122 , etc. Character table \u00b6 We have put the most frequent special characters in the Character Table . To insert a special character from the Character Table , follow these steps: Press Ctrl + Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the Character Table . Double-click the character ou want to insert. Autotext \u00b6 Alternatively, you may use Autotext entries to insert a special character by typing a shortcut. You can see the list of available shortcuts here . Let's see some examples: For example, to write the abbreviation of square meters (\"m\u00b2\"), you can type shortcut \\sup2 to insert superindex character \u00b2 . Another example: in chemical formulas, the number of atoms is often noted with a subindex number, e.g. \"CO\u2082\". To insert character \u2082 , type shortcut \\sub2 . In order to insert a non-breaking space, type \\nbsp : the auto-completer will propose to insert the character from the autotext list. Running concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to find words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word or fragment you want to search for with your mouse. While that part of the text is selected, press Ctrl + F on your keyboard. Press the Search button in the Search window that will open. The list results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl + C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the right place in the translation. Note There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. QA checks \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments in the project must have a translation. To confirm that is the case, please check for completion before your delivery. To check completion, hover with your mouse pointer over the progress status bar, in the bottom right corner of OmegaT's main window. That bar shows some statistics: unique translated (unique left) per file (e.g. 100% (0 left) as above) unique translated (unique left) per project (e.g. 100% (0 left) as above) total number of segments (e.g. 54 as above) If you see something like 100% (0 left) / 100% (0 left), 54 , that means that all 54 segments in the project are translated. If you see a number higher that zero segments left, the translation is not complete. If you have left some segment untranslated, proceed as follows to correct it: Press Esc to close the Project Files window. Press Ctrl + U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . Translate the segment Repeat the steps above until no untranslated segments remain. Finally, check the progress status bar again to confirm completion now. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools > Check Issues to open the Issues window. Tip You may untick the other checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) if you want to focus on tags only first. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one. For every issue in the list, do the following: Click a row in the list (or click on Jump to Segment ) to open that segment in the editor Fix the tag issue (as explained in the Fixing tag issues section) Press the Refresh button to update the list of issues. Avoid Please do not click on \"Apply fix\" fix each issue manually. Tip If the source text has tags that you do not use in your language, you can insert them at the end of the segment to avoid having false positives in the error report. That should not have an impact on the translation. Check glossary adherence \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools > Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press OK A list of potential errors will open: Go through the issues one by one. For every issue in the list, do the following: Click a row in the list (or click on Jump to Segment ) to open that segment in the editor. Correct the error if necessary. Press the Refresh button to update the list of issues. Info Not all flagged issues are errors by default. In some cases, you may get false positives . In the screenshot below, \"apple trees\" should be translated as \"pommiers\" as in the first segment. In the second segment (active segment) \"apple trees\" was rendered as \"ces arbres\" (backtranslation: these trees) to avoid a repetition that would be disturbing in French. Such deviations from the glossary are intentional, no you would disregard the issue. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl + Shift + D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your latest changes. To access the file, go to Project > Access Project Contents > Target Files to open your file explorer in the /target folder of the project. The file you were working on should be there: preview it to read the translation in context. Delivery \u00b6 Once you have finished your task in the OmegaT project and have performed the relevant QA checks, you need to deliver the project. The delivery mode will vary depending on whether it's an offline project or a team project . Online / team project (via repository) \u00b6 To deliver from a team project: Go to Project > Commit Target Files . That's it! Offline project (via package) \u00b6 Go to Project > Pack project as OMT file... In the window that pops up, select the location where you want to save the OMT package. Press Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. The folder where exported package is stored will open automatically in your file explorer.

Inserting terms from the glossary \u00b6 When the active segment contains a source term that is in the glossary, it is underlined in blue in the source text. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane, on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding new entries to the glossary \u00b6 Tip Feeding the glossary with technical or sensitive wording or terms or expressions that appear frequently can be very useful to speed up typing, to keep consistency, to avoid typos, etc.. To add a new term entry to the glossary: In the active segment, drag your mouse over the term you want to insert to select it . Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu. In the Create Glossary Entry that will pop up, enter the target term (and any comments you want). Press the OK button to save the new entry. Handling repetitions \u00b6 Some segments may be repeated in the project. By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be a bit treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you grasp and follow the three steps above to the letter and you should be fine. Other useful features \u00b6 Inserting source segment in target \u00b6 In some cases, the translation must be identical to the source text. To copy the source text in the translation, press Ctrl + Shift + S on your keyboard. Of course, you may also copy-paste the source text in the translation if you prefer. Creating an empty translation \u00b6 All segments must have a translation, even if it's an empty translation. If you want to produce an empty translation, simply press the space bar in your keyboard to insert a space as the translation. Inserting special characters \u00b6 You may need to type special characters such as: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb , \u201e\u201c , \u2018\u2019 , etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7 , \u03c0 , \u00f7 , \u2264 , \u2260 , \u221a , etc. superindex or subindex numbers or letters: \u2082 , \u00b2 , \u00b3 , etc. other characters: \u00ae , \u2122 , etc. Character table \u00b6 We have put the most frequent special characters in the Character Table . To insert a special character from the Character Table , follow these steps: Press Ctrl + Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the Character Table . Double-click the character ou want to insert. Autotext \u00b6 Alternatively, you may use Autotext entries to insert a special character by typing a shortcut. You can see the list of available shortcuts here . Let's see some examples: For example, to write the abbreviation of square meters (\"m\u00b2\"), you can type shortcut \\sup2 to insert superindex character \u00b2 . Another example: in chemical formulas, the number of atoms is often noted with a subindex number, e.g. \"CO\u2082\". To insert character \u2082 , type shortcut \\sub2 . In order to insert a non-breaking space, type \\nbsp : the auto-completer will propose to insert the character from the autotext list. Running concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to find words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word or fragment you want to search for with your mouse. While that part of the text is selected, press Ctrl + F on your keyboard. Press the Search button in the Search window that will open. The list results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl + C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the right place in the translation. Note There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. QA checks \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments in the project must have a translation. To confirm that is the case, please check for completion before your delivery. To check completion, hover with your mouse pointer over the progress status bar, in the bottom right corner of OmegaT's main window. That bar shows some statistics: unique translated (unique left) per file (e.g. 100% (0 left) as above) unique translated (unique left) per project (e.g. 100% (0 left) as above) total number of segments (e.g. 54 as above) If you see something like 100% (0 left) / 100% (0 left), 54 , that means that all 54 segments in the project are translated. If you see a number higher that zero segments left, the translation is not complete. If you have left some segment untranslated, proceed as follows to correct it: Press Esc to close the Project Files window. Press Ctrl + U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . Translate the segment Repeat the steps above until no untranslated segments remain. Finally, check the progress status bar again to confirm completion now. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools > Check Issues to open the Issues window. Tip You may untick the other checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) if you want to focus on tags only first. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one. For every issue in the list, do the following: Click a row in the list (or click on Jump to Segment ) to open that segment in the editor Fix the tag issue (as explained in the Fixing tag issues section) Press the Refresh button to update the list of issues. Avoid Please do not click on \"Apply fix\" fix each issue manually. Tip If the source text has tags that you do not use in your language, you can insert them at the end of the segment to avoid having false positives in the error report. That should not have an impact on the translation. Check glossary adherence \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools > Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press OK A list of potential errors will open: Go through the issues one by one. For every issue in the list, do the following: Click a row in the list (or click on Jump to Segment ) to open that segment in the editor. Correct the error if necessary. Press the Refresh button to update the list of issues. Info Not all flagged issues are errors by default. In some cases, you may get false positives . In the screenshot below, \"apple trees\" should be translated as \"pommiers\" as in the first segment. In the second segment (active segment) \"apple trees\" was rendered as \"ces arbres\" (backtranslation: these trees) to avoid a repetition that would be disturbing in French. Such deviations from the glossary are intentional, no you would disregard the issue. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl + Shift + D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your latest changes. To access the file, go to Project > Access Project Contents > Target Files to open your file explorer in the /target folder of the project. The file you were working on should be there: preview it to read the translation in context. Delivery \u00b6 Once you have finished your task in the OmegaT project and have performed the relevant QA checks, you need to deliver the project. The delivery mode will vary depending on whether it's an offline project or a team project . Online / team project (via repository) \u00b6 To deliver from a team project: Go to Project > Commit Target Files . That's it! Offline project (via package) \u00b6 Go to Project > Pack project as OMT file... In the window that pops up, select the location where you want to save the OMT package. Press Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. The folder where exported package is stored will open automatically in your file explorer. You will recognize the package because it has the extension .omt . That's the file you have to deliver.

The software has been customized to optimize your task. Installation and setup \u00b6 To install and customize OmegaT on a computer running Windows, please follow these steps: If you use Mac or Linux, please get in touch with our Helpdesk. Your user Name/ID \u00b6 When opening OmegaT for the first time, please update your Name/ID. To do that click on Options > Preferences > Team . The Name/ID box might already contain your username. If that's the case, just prepend it with VER . If the box is empty, please enter VER_your-name (e.g. VER_souto , VER_msoutopico , etc.). Then press OK. Accessing the project \u00b6 Tip Please give some thought to the organization of your files and folders before you proceed with the steps below. We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://some-bar-domain.com/some/path/to/the/foo-repository.git . To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. Let's assume it's C:/Work/ (but please use whatever path is appropriate on your end). Copy the URL of the project repository. In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. To do that: Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. C:/Work/ . Then, in the New Local Project Folder field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. Then, press Ctrl + V to paste your path in replacemenet of the deleted part. Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear. You can open a project that already exists only after you have already unpacked it or downloaded it. In turn, you only download or unpack a project that doesn't exist yet in your machine. Navigation \u00b6 Navigation across panes \u00b6 When you open OmegaT you will notice the screen is split in several panes: The Editor pane is the main pane in which you will be working. Translation suggestions will appear in the Fuzzy Matches pane (or just Matches pane). The Glossary pane will display the existing glossary entries and the ones you may add. The Multiple Translations pane will show if a repeated segment has alternative translations. Navigation through files \u00b6 If the project contains multiple files, they are listed in the Project Files window. The file currently open is highlighted in blue. If you want to open a different file in the Editor pane, click on it in the Project Files window. You can also see the name of the file that is open in the Editor pane's title bar. The following video shows navigation through files: Navigation through segments \u00b6 In the editor pane, the active segment is highlighted in green. This is the segment you are working on. When you type or insert a translation, it will appear right below the source text . Press Enter on your keyboard to go to the next segment. You can also use Ctrl + U to jump to the next untranslated segment. A segment can also be activated by double clicking on it, it then becomes green. In OmegaT, the color of the segment's background will help you find your way around between the different segments: Color Language Meaning Green Source active segment (the segment you are working on) Blue Source untranslated segment Grey Source manually translated segment Pink Target pretranslated segment Orange Target pretranslated and locked segment (e.g. trend) Caution If you want to change a trend translation, document it in the monitoring form but do not try to change it in OmegaT. Any changes you make to these segments will not be saved. The existing translation will be maintained. The following video shows navigation through segments, enjoy : Warning All segments should appear translated for an editing task (such as verification, proofreading, etc.), i.e. highlighted either in gray or in orange (trend, pretranslated and locked) or in pink (pretranslated). If you notice an untranslated segment in blue , please contact cApStAn's project managers to see how it should be handled. Editing \u00b6 Revising the translation \u00b6 Move through segments one by one by pressing the Enter key. When you press the Enter key, you move from one segment to the next one, activating the segment you jump to. Read every translation, comparing with the source text. You may have received more specific instructions for your particular task. Editing a segment to correct an error \u00b6 To make a segment editable, you must activate it. You can only edit the active segment. You can recognize the active segment because it is highlighted in green. You can also activate a specific segment by double-clicking it. When you double-click a segment, it becomes active and you can then edit it. Handling tags \u00b6 Recognizing tags \u00b6 If a segment which contains tags, you will recognize them because they are in red font . There are two types of tags: standalone tags and paired tags or double tags: Standalone tags : a single tag with a precise role (e.g. <x1/> tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g1> and </g1> ) and affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the translation as in the source text. Inserting tags \u00b6 To insert tags in your translation, you should use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + T , which inserts the next missing tag. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. If you need to insert tags in a different order than in the source, we advise you to translate the entire segment, place your cursor where the first tag has to be inserted and press Ctrl + T , then repeat the operation until all tags have been inserted. If you have inserted a tag incorrectly and need to delete it, select the tag in full (you can double click on it) and press backspace or delete on your keyboard. @WIP: Basically: before inserting a tag you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags. if standalone: click on the position where you want to insert the tag if paired: select... etc. then, fixing: remove and insert again, or drag and drop Using matches \u00b6 Translations are saved in the working TM of the project. When you open a segment that is similar to one that has already been translated, you will see translation suggestions (or matches) appearing in the Matches pane. The source text in the Matches pane uses \u201ctrack changes\u201d mode to show the differences (e.g. old new ) between the new source text in the active segment and the source text in the fuzzy match selected. Parts that do not appear in the active segment are stricken through Parts that appear in the match are underlined Also, the Matches pane shows a similarity score that tells you how different the new source text is from the source text of every match. When there are several matches for a segment, they are sorted by their similarity to the new segment. The active match is the one in bold (by default, the one at the top of the list). If you want to use a different match, double click on it to activate it. To insert the match in full, press Ctrl + I on your keyboard. After inserting it, do not forget to make any necessary changes so that it fits the segment you are translating. Alternatively, you can also insert only a part of the fuzzy match or combine several matches: Double-click the match you want to use to activate it With your mouse, select the part you wish to insert Press Ctrl + I on your keyboard to insert it Do the same to insert (part of) other matches if appropriate or finish translating the segment. Using the glossary \u00b6 OmegaT supports glossaries. Your project may already contain a glossary with key terms, but you can also add terms to the glossary yourself. Help yourself! Adding new term pairs to the glossary might seem like extra work, but if done well it will be of valuable help to insert frequent expressions or to ensure that sensitive terms are translated consistently across the project. Inserting terms from the glossary \u00b6 When the active segment contains a source term that is in the glossary, it is underlined in blue in the source text. You will see the suggested target term in the Glossary pane, on the right. OmegaT has predictive typing : when you start typing the first character of the target term in the glossary, the auto-completer will suggest the term. To insert it, press Enter on your keyboard. Adding new entries to the glossary \u00b6 Tip Feeding the glossary with technical or sensitive wording or terms or expressions that appear frequently can be very useful to speed up typing, to keep consistency, to avoid typos, etc.. To add a new term entry to the glossary: In the active segment, drag your mouse over the term you want to insert to select it . Right click and choose Add glossary entry from the contextual menu. In the Create Glossary Entry that will pop up, enter the target term (and any comments you want). Press the OK button to save the new entry. Handling repetitions \u00b6 Some segments may be repeated in the project. By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be a bit treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you grasp and follow the three steps above to the letter and you should be fine. Other useful features \u00b6 Inserting source segment in target \u00b6 In some cases, the translation must be identical to the source text. To copy the source text in the translation, press Ctrl + Shift + S on your keyboard. Of course, you may also copy-paste the source text in the translation if you prefer. Creating an empty translation \u00b6 All segments must have a translation, even if it's an empty translation. If you want to produce an empty translation, simply press the space bar in your keyboard to insert a space as the translation. Inserting special characters \u00b6 You may need to type special characters such as: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb , \u201e\u201c , \u2018\u2019 , etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7 , \u03c0 , \u00f7 , \u2264 , \u2260 , \u221a , etc. superindex or subindex numbers or letters: \u2082 , \u00b2 , \u00b3 , etc. other characters: \u00ae , \u2122 , etc. Character table \u00b6 We have put the most frequent special characters in the Character Table . To insert a special character from the Character Table , follow these steps: Press Ctrl + Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the Character Table . Double-click the character ou want to insert. Autotext \u00b6 Alternatively, you may use Autotext entries to insert a special character by typing a shortcut. You can see the list of available shortcuts here . Let's see some examples: For example, to write the abbreviation of square meters (\"m\u00b2\"), you can type shortcut \\sup2 to insert superindex character \u00b2 . Another example: in chemical formulas, the number of atoms is often noted with a subindex number, e.g. \"CO\u2082\". To insert character \u2082 , type shortcut \\sub2 . In order to insert a non-breaking space, type \\nbsp : the auto-completer will propose to insert the character from the autotext list. Running concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to find words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary. To perform a search follow the steps below: In the active segment, select the word or fragment you want to search for with your mouse. While that part of the text is selected, press Ctrl + F on your keyboard. Press the Search button in the Search window that will open. The list results will be displayed. You can copy (select with mouse and press Ctrl + C on your keyboard) what you need from the results and paste it in the right place in the translation. Note There might be small differences (in punctuation, spacing, etc.) between the text you're searching for and other occurrences of the same text that would prevent an exact match . The option \"Keyword search\" might help overcome that problem, please use it if you don't get the results you were expecting. QA checks \u00b6 Completion check \u00b6 All segments in the project must have a translation. To confirm that is the case, please check for completion before your delivery. To check completion, hover with your mouse pointer over the progress status bar, in the bottom right corner of OmegaT's main window. That bar shows some statistics: unique translated (unique left) per file (e.g. 100% (0 left) as above) unique translated (unique left) per project (e.g. 100% (0 left) as above) total number of segments (e.g. 54 as above) If you see something like 100% (0 left) / 100% (0 left), 54 , that means that all 54 segments in the project are translated. If you see a number higher that zero segments left, the translation is not complete. If you have left some segment untranslated, proceed as follows to correct it: Press Esc to close the Project Files window. Press Ctrl + U on your keyboard to jump to the Next Untranslated Segment . Translate the segment Repeat the steps above until no untranslated segments remain. Finally, check the progress status bar again to confirm completion now. Check and fix tags \u00b6 To ensure that all tags have been inserted correctly: Go to Tools > Check Issues to open the Issues window. Tip You may untick the other checks (Spelling, Terminology, LanguageTool) if you want to focus on tags only first. Press OK . An error report will open. Go through the issues one by one. For every issue in the list, do the following: Click a row in the list (or click on Jump to Segment ) to open that segment in the editor Fix the tag issue (as explained in the Fixing tag issues section) Press the Refresh button to update the list of issues. Avoid Please do not click on \"Apply fix\" fix each issue manually. Tip If the source text has tags that you do not use in your language, you can insert them at the end of the segment to avoid having false positives in the error report. That should not have an impact on the translation. Check glossary adherence \u00b6 You can check whether the translation adheres to the glossary and key terms have been translated consistently throughout: Go to Tools > Check Issues Make sure the box next to Terminology Issues is ticked Press OK A list of potential errors will open: Go through the issues one by one. For every issue in the list, do the following: Click a row in the list (or click on Jump to Segment ) to open that segment in the editor. Correct the error if necessary. Press the Refresh button to update the list of issues. Info Not all flagged issues are errors by default. In some cases, you may get false positives . In the screenshot below, \"apple trees\" should be translated as \"pommiers\" as in the first segment. In the second segment (active segment) \"apple trees\" was rendered as \"ces arbres\" (backtranslation: these trees) to avoid a repetition that would be disturbing in French. Such deviations from the glossary are intentional, no you would disregard the issue. Creating target files \u00b6 Press Ctrl + Shift + D to create the target file you were working on. This will allow you to preview the translated file with your latest changes. To access the file, go to Project > Access Project Contents > Target Files to open your file explorer in the /target folder of the project. The file you were working on should be there: preview it to read the translation in context. Delivery \u00b6 Once you have finished your task in the OmegaT project and have performed the relevant QA checks, you need to deliver the project. The delivery mode will vary depending on whether it's an offline project or a team project . Online / team project (via repository) \u00b6 To deliver from a team project: Go to Project > Commit Target Files . That's it! Offline project (via package) \u00b6 Go to Project > Pack project as OMT file... In the window that pops up, select the location where you want to save the OMT package. Press Save Press OK in the Pop-up window notifying that the package was successfully created. The folder where exported package is stored will open automatically in your file explorer. You will recognize the package because it has the extension .omt . That's the file you have to deliver.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://some-bar-domain.com/some/path/to/the/foo-repository.git . To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. Let's assume it's C:/Work/ (but please use whatever path is appropriate on your end). Copy the URL of the project repository. In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. To do that: Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. C:/Work/ . Then, in the New Local Project Folder field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. Then, press Ctrl + V to paste your path in replacemenet of the deleted part. Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear. You can open a project that already exists only after you have already unpacked it or downloaded it. In turn, you only download or unpack a project that doesn't exist yet in your machine.","title":"Accessing the project"},{"location":"verification/accessing-the-project/#accessing-the-project","text":"Tip Please give some thought to the organization of your files and folders before you proceed with the steps below.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Create alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts.

There are two types of tags: standalone tags and paired tags or double tags: Standalone tags : a single tag with a precise role (e.g. <x1/> tag which introduces a new paragraph in HTML) Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g1> and </g1> ) and affect the text between them and you need to ensure they are positioned around the exact same words in the translation as in the source text. Inserting tags \u00b6 To insert tags in your translation, you should use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + T , which inserts the next missing tag. Please note that tags are inserted in the order of their appearance in the source segment. If you need to insert tags in a different order than in the source, we advise you to translate the entire segment, place your cursor where the first tag has to be inserted and press Ctrl + T , then repeat the operation until all tags have been inserted. If you have inserted a tag incorrectly and need to delete it, select the tag in full (you can double click on it) and press backspace or delete on your keyboard. @WIP: Basically: before inserting a tag you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags. if standalone: click on the position where you want to insert the tag if paired: select... etc. then, fixing: remove and insert again, or drag and drop Fixing tag issues \u00b6 All tags you see in the source text should be present in the translation too.
