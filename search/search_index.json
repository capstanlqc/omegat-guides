When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text. For example, here the paired tags represent some formatting that applies to the word \"after\" and its translation \"apr\u00e8s\".

When the source text contains one or more standalone tags , you must insert them in the translation in a position that is equivalent to their position in the source text. In the following example, the standalone tag represents a text entry field where the respondent will have to select a number: <x1/> hours > <x1/> heures Inserting tags \u00b6 Before inserting tags you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment.

See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation.

If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project.

To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags: standalone tags and paired tags or double tags: Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text.

Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment.

In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update.

See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation.

In OmegaT, those inline codes are handled as tags . For example, part of the source text could be, say, underlined (e.g. the word \"after\" below): I came to this school after the start of this school year. The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags : standalone tags and paired tags or double tags : Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text. For example, here the paired tags represent some formatting that applies to the word \"after\" and its translation \"apr\u00e8s\". I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. Je suis venu \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole <g1> apr\u00e8s </g1> le d\u00e9but de cette ann\u00e9e scolaire. When the source text contains one or more standalone tags , you must insert them in the translation in a position that is equivalent to their position in the source text. In the following example, the standalone tag represents a text entry field where the respondent will have to select a number: <x1/> hours > <x1/> heures Inserting tags \u00b6 Before inserting tags you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags . To insert paired tags in your translation, proceed as follows: Translate the segment. Select the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted part in the source text.

That is convenient in many cases, but not always. Sometimes you'll have to prevent auto-propagation. To do that, you must create an alternative translation . Exercise 06.1: create alternative translation \u00b6 Go to segment #16 in the project. Source text reads: Pretty good Notice that it is translated with an auto-propagated translation. Pretty good and Pretty bad in segments #16 and #17 in this context refer to \"level of English\" which is masculine in French.

Alternative translations \u00b6 In the previous section you saw that translations of repeated segments (or edits in those translations) auto-propagate to all instances of that repeated segment when you save them (or leave the segment). That is convenient in many cases, but not always. Sometimes you'll have to prevent auto-propagation. To do that, you must create an alternative translation .

Good and Bad in segments #5 and #6 in this context refer to \"level of English\" which is masculine in French. However, your translation (\"BonNE\" and \"MauvaisE\") refers to \"situation economique\" and therefore is feminine.

That applies to text in any language except languages written in a right-to-left (RTL) script, like Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, etc., in which case the segment flows from right to left (RTL) and is aligned to the right. Global text direction and alignment of source and target segments is determined by the source and target languages, respectively, indicated in the project settings. Depending on the language, segments are aligned either to the left or to the right. On the other hand, while text direction at the segment level is determined by the project settings, text direction might change inside the segment depending on the script used. For example, English text in a LTR segment will flow left to right but a quotation in Arabic in that same segment will flow right to left. Since OmegaT users are only responsible for producing the translation, let\u2019s focus on what happens in target segments. Everything that follows applies to source segments too, with the difference that they are not directly editable in the translation editor in OmegaT. Bidirectionality mode \u00b6 The bidirectionality mode activates either when at least one of the two languages in the project uses a RTL script or when some text in a RTL is inserted. When the bidirectionality mode is activated, text direction is indicated by a flag on the top of the cursor. In the image below, notice how by default the cursor flag points left in a RTL segment but it may point left or right depending on the previous character: In text written in an LTR script, text flows from left to right, which means that the cursor flag points right and every character typed in LTR script always appears to the right of the previous one. That is always the case for the whole LTR segment unless it contains some fragment in an RTL script, in which case the rules for RTL text apply within that fragment. Strong and weak directionality \u00b6 In text written in an RTL script, text flows from right to left or left to right depending on the characters typed. Alphabetic characters have a RTL directionality: after each alphabetical character, the cursor flag points left, which means that if a new character is inserted, it will appear to the left of the cursor. On the other hand, numeric characters have a LTR directionality: after each number, the cursor flag points right, which means that if a new number is inserted, it will appear to the right of the cursor. Strings in LTR script will behave like numbers. Letters and numbers have a strong directionality, which means that they always flow in the same direction: letters in RTL script flow from right to left, letters in LTR flow from left to right, and numbers in any script always flow from left to right too. However, other characters like punctuation symbols do not have an intrinsic directionality of their own and will inherit the directionality of the segment (hence called of weak or neutral directionality): one same character (e.g. +, as in the image above) will flow right to left in a RTL segment, whereas it will flow left to right in a LTR segment. Orientation \u00b6 Some characters, such as quotation marks, are purely bidirectional and may also have a different orientation depending on the directionality of the segment. For example, the opening double angle quotation mark (Unicode U+00AB) points left when used in a LTR segment, but the same character points right when used in a RTL segment. In the image below, an autotext entry is used to insert that character in an LTR segment: In the image below, in turn, the same autotext entry is used to insert the same character in a LTR segment: The same thing would happen with any other double characters with neutral directionality, such as parenthesis, square brackets, curly brackets, etc. The opening character will point left or right depending on the directionality of the text stretch where it is inserted. Bidirectionality control characters \u00b6 Often the default behaviour described above is fine, but when you\u2019re mixing RTL text and LTR text or using special characters with weak directionality in RTL, you might need to use Unicode bidirectionality control characters (or bidi characters for short) to achieve the expected directionality. Bidi control characters can be found in the menu Edit > Insert Unicode Control Characters and may be used to: insert an invisible character with a certain strong directionality to force a specific position for a character with weak directionality create an embedding which works as a sort of protective environment within which text can flow in the opposite direction of the segment. These control characters are invisible, nothing is display or printed, but they change directionality. If you want to see where these characters are inserted, you can activate option View > Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters . Marks \u00b6 Let\u2019s see a few examples. Some expressions and brand names combine symbols with letters, e.g. Yahoo!, C++, C#, Hola!, Chips Ahoy!, etc. If you must write, say, \u201cC++\u201d in Arabic, you will notice that by default the + characters will appear to the left of the letter C: That is obviously incorrect. To force the correct position of the ++ characters, type C, then ++, then insert a left-to-right mark (or LRM for short) at the end. The ++ part will then be surrounded by two characters with strong LTR directionality (namely, the letter C and the LRM) and therefore will inherit the directionality of those characters and flow left to right instead of inheriting the directionality of the segment and flow right to left. See that in action in the following image: You might be tempted to type characters in reverse order: first ++, then C. Even though that might look good, that is logically wrong and could bring about issues when the text is further processed later or subjected to different uses. For example, if you type ++C in Arabic, even if it looks visually correct in the translation editor, it will not appear in search results when a user looks for \u201cC++\u201d in the Arabic document. Let alone the fact that often, if the expression is a bit complex, you\u2019ll struggle with trial and error until you obtain something that (only) looks as expected (although underneath it is wrong). Don\u2019t try to fake the looks. LRM and RLM (marks) characters are enough when you must change the directionality and position of one character only at the end or beginning of one homogeneous chunk of text. However, when the expression that must flow in the opposite direction contains several parts separated by spaces, or contains non-alphanumeric characters as well as alphanumeric characters, it\u2019s often better to use RTL or LTR embeddings. Embeddings \u00b6 The behaviour of embeddings is a bit different from that of marks. For starters, two characters must be inserted: one to start the embedding and another one to pop out of it. For example, to create a LTR embedding in an RTL segment, you would insert a left-to-right embedding (LRE) character, then the LTR text, then the pop directional formatting (PDF) character. Likewise, to create a RTL embedding in an LTR segment, you would insert a right-to-left embedding (RLE) character, then the RTL text, then the PDF character. Let\u2019s see an example. Equations, formulas and mathematical notation in general are expressions that must normally run left-to-right in bidirectional languages like Arabic or Hebrew, just like in English. Simply typing or copy-pasting an equation in Arabic will not produce the correct result, as can be seen in the image below: Instead, you should proceed in this way to create a LTR embedding: insert the LRE character, then type or insert the equation, finally insert the PDF character. See that in action: Notice how the red square rim appears around the LTR embedding right after inserting the PDF character, when the option Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters is activated in the View menu.", "title": "Bidirectionality"}, {"location": "en/misc/bidi/#handling-bidirectionality-in-omegat", "text": "", "title": "Handling bidirectionality in OmegaT"}, {"location": "en/misc/bidi/#text-direction-and-text-alignment", "text": "By default, text direction in the translation editor is left to right (LTR) and text is aligned to the left.

That is always the case for the whole LTR segment unless it contains some fragment in an RTL script, in which case the rules for RTL text apply within that fragment.", "title": "Bidirectionality mode"}, {"location": "en/misc/bidi/#strong-and-weak-directionality", "text": "In text written in an RTL script, text flows from right to left or left to right depending on the characters typed. Alphabetic characters have a RTL directionality: after each alphabetical character, the cursor flag points left, which means that if a new character is inserted, it will appear to the left of the cursor. On the other hand, numeric characters have a LTR directionality: after each number, the cursor flag points right, which means that if a new number is inserted, it will appear to the right of the cursor. Strings in LTR script will behave like numbers. Letters and numbers have a strong directionality, which means that they always flow in the same direction: letters in RTL script flow from right to left, letters in LTR flow from left to right, and numbers in any script always flow from left to right too. However, other characters like punctuation symbols do not have an intrinsic directionality of their own and will inherit the directionality of the segment (hence called of weak or neutral directionality): one same character (e.g. +, as in the image above) will flow right to left in a RTL segment, whereas it will flow left to right in a LTR segment.", "title": "Strong and weak directionality"}, {"location": "en/misc/bidi/#orientation", "text": "Some characters, such as quotation marks, are purely bidirectional and may also have a different orientation depending on the directionality of the segment. For example, the opening double angle quotation mark (Unicode U+00AB) points left when used in a LTR segment, but the same character points right when used in a RTL segment. In the image below, an autotext entry is used to insert that character in an LTR segment: In the image below, in turn, the same autotext entry is used to insert the same character in a LTR segment: The same thing would happen with any other double characters with neutral directionality, such as parenthesis, square brackets, curly brackets, etc. The opening character will point left or right depending on the directionality of the text stretch where it is inserted.", "title": "Orientation"}, {"location": "en/misc/bidi/#bidirectionality-control-characters", "text": "Often the default behaviour described above is fine, but when you\u2019re mixing RTL text and LTR text or using special characters with weak directionality in RTL, you might need to use Unicode bidirectionality control characters (or bidi characters for short) to achieve the expected directionality. Bidi control characters can be found in the menu Edit > Insert Unicode Control Characters and may be used to: insert an invisible character with a certain strong directionality to force a specific position for a character with weak directionality create an embedding which works as a sort of protective environment within which text can flow in the opposite direction of the segment. These control characters are invisible, nothing is display or printed, but they change directionality. If you want to see where these characters are inserted, you can activate option View > Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters .", "title": "Bidirectionality control characters"}, {"location": "en/misc/bidi/#marks", "text": "Let\u2019s see a few examples. Some expressions and brand names combine symbols with letters, e.g. Yahoo!, C++, C#, Hola!, Chips Ahoy!, etc. If you must write, say, \u201cC++\u201d in Arabic, you will notice that by default the + characters will appear to the left of the letter C: That is obviously incorrect. To force the correct position of the ++ characters, type C, then ++, then insert a left-to-right mark (or LRM for short) at the end. The ++ part will then be surrounded by two characters with strong LTR directionality (namely, the letter C and the LRM) and therefore will inherit the directionality of those characters and flow left to right instead of inheriting the directionality of the segment and flow right to left. See that in action in the following image: You might be tempted to type characters in reverse order: first ++, then C. Even though that might look good, that is logically wrong and could bring about issues when the text is further processed later or subjected to different uses. For example, if you type ++C in Arabic, even if it looks visually correct in the translation editor, it will not appear in search results when a user looks for \u201cC++\u201d in the Arabic document. Let alone the fact that often, if the expression is a bit complex, you\u2019ll struggle with trial and error until you obtain something that (only) looks as expected (although underneath it is wrong). Don\u2019t try to fake the looks. LRM and RLM (marks) characters are enough when you must change the directionality and position of one character only at the end or beginning of one homogeneous chunk of text. However, when the expression that must flow in the opposite direction contains several parts separated by spaces, or contains non-alphanumeric characters as well as alphanumeric characters, it\u2019s often better to use RTL or LTR embeddings.", "title": "Marks"}, {"location": "en/misc/bidi/#embeddings", "text": "The behaviour of embeddings is a bit different from that of marks. For starters, two characters must be inserted: one to start the embedding and another one to pop out of it. For example, to create a LTR embedding in an RTL segment, you would insert a left-to-right embedding (LRE) character, then the LTR text, then the pop directional formatting (PDF) character. Likewise, to create a RTL embedding in an LTR segment, you would insert a right-to-left embedding (RLE) character, then the RTL text, then the PDF character. Let\u2019s see an example. Equations, formulas and mathematical notation in general are expressions that must normally run left-to-right in bidirectional languages like Arabic or Hebrew, just like in English. Simply typing or copy-pasting an equation in Arabic will not produce the correct result, as can be seen in the image below: Instead, you should proceed in this way to create a LTR embedding: insert the LRE character, then type or insert the equation, finally insert the PDF character.

Updating Windows malware definitions \u00b6 Before downloading the installation files (OmegaT installer and customization utility), you should update Windows Defender's definitions.

If you obtain the same values, you can be certain that you have the same file as it\u2019s available for download and that it\u2019s safe to whitelist it. Java maintenance \u00b6 OmegaT is developed in Java and needs JRE to run. The OmegaT installers we recommend include the version of JRE that OmegaT needs, and that JRE would be uninstalled when OmegaT is uninstalled. However, in any case, as Java can be a security risk if it\u2019s not kept up to date, it\u2019s worth maintaining that version of JRE up to date after installed if necessary. Data leakage \u00b6 OmegaT can check for new versions, get MT results, get glossary matches from TaaS, download MediaWiki links and use them as source files, have remote files on HTTP, Git and SVN servers mapped locally, and then there's SVN/Git team project functionality. We're not using any of those functions in the translation of the PISA/PIAAC materials, which means we won't instruct users to configure or use them. However, it\u2019s always possible that the user unilaterally uses them. If this is a concern for the organization, OmegaT could be made to work in a complete offline manner, namely it could be started with a non-functional proxy, so it won't connect to internet at all (specifying a non-existing proxy server, e.g. 270.270, in the startup parameters in the OmegaT.l4J.ini file). In other words, it\u2019s up to the organization and their internal policy to decide how much access to the internet it must be allowed to OmegaT. Open source \u00b6 In case of any concerns about vulnerabilities in OmegaT against viruses or other malware, the source code is freely available and used to build software packages in several OS distributions. Any Java engineer can inspect the code and conduct any tests to assess its robustness and reliability. Endorsement by big organizations \u00b6 The European Commission has been promoting the use of open-source software namely within its [R&D programmes]. It is in this context that open source applications like OmegaT are being used in DGT (the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Translation), alongside other commercial applications. DGT has been using OmegaT for prototyping since 2012, customizing it and extending it with some useful improvements. This information can be useful to endorse the usage of OmegaT.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you follow the three steps above precisely. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : Warning Remember that you can't create an alternative translation if the segment already has an alternative translation. See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation. To do that, follow these simple steps: Go to the segment where you want to restore the default translation Press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to select the whole target text Press the Del on your keyboard to delete the translation Press Ctrl + S to save (or leave the segment) to restore the default translation", "title": "Repetitions"}, {"location": "en/reconciliation/repetitions/#handling-repetitions", "text": "Some segments may be repeated in the project.

You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project .

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment.

See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation. To do that, follow these simple steps: Go to the segment where you want to restore the default translation Press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to select the whole target text Press the Del on your keyboard to delete the translation Press Ctrl + S to save (or leave the segment) to restore the default translation", "title": "Repetitions"}, {"location": "en/review/repetitions/#handling-repetitions", "text": "Some segments may be repeated in the project.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update.

See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ).

That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active.

Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation.

The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags : standalone tags and paired tags or double tags : Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text. For example, here the paired tags represent some formatting that applies to the word \"after\" and its translation \"apr\u00e8s\". I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. Je suis venu \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole <g1> apr\u00e8s </g1> le d\u00e9but de cette ann\u00e9e scolaire. When the source text contains one or more standalone tags , you must insert them in the translation in a position that is equivalent to their position in the source text. In the following example, the standalone tag represents a text entry field where the respondent will have to select a number: <x1/> hours > <x1/> heures Inserting tags \u00b6 Before inserting tags you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags .

A tooltip will show the original inline code:", "title": "What are tags"}, {"location": "en/translation/tags/#types-of-tags", "text": "There are two types of tags : standalone tags and paired tags or double tags : Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text. For example, here the paired tags represent some formatting that applies to the word \"after\" and its translation \"apr\u00e8s\". I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. Je suis venu \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole <g1> apr\u00e8s </g1> le d\u00e9but de cette ann\u00e9e scolaire. When the source text contains one or more standalone tags , you must insert them in the translation in a position that is equivalent to their position in the source text. In the following example, the standalone tag represents a text entry field where the respondent will have to select a number: <x1/> hours > <x1/> heures", "title": "Types of tags"}, {"location": "en/translation/tags/#inserting-tags", "text": "Before inserting tags you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags .

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you follow the three steps above precisely. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : Warning Remember that you can't create an alternative translation if the segment already has an alternative translation. See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation. To do that, follow these simple steps: Go to the segment where you want to restore the default translation Press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to select the whole target text Press the Del on your keyboard to delete the translation Press Ctrl + S to save (or leave the segment) to restore the default translation", "title": "Repetitions"}, {"location": "en/verification/repetitions/#handling-repetitions", "text": "Some segments may be repeated in the project.

The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags : standalone tags and paired tags or double tags : Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text.

Inserting special characters \u00b6 You may need to type special characters such as: quotation marks: \u00ab\u00bb , \u201e\u201c , \u2018\u2019 , etc. mathematical symbols: \u00d7 , \u03c0 , \u00f7 , \u2264 , \u2260 , \u221a , etc. superindex or subindex numbers or letters: \u2082 , \u00b2 , \u00b3 , etc. other characters: \u00ae , \u2122 , etc. Character table \u00b6 We put the most frequent special characters in the Character Table . To insert a special character from the Character Table , follow these steps: Press Ctrl + Space on your keyboard several times until you reach the Character Table . Double-click the character you want to insert. Autotext \u00b6 Alternatively, you may use Autotext entries to insert a special character by typing a shortcut. You can see the list of available shortcuts here . Let's see some examples: For example, to write the abbreviation of square meters (\"m\u00b2\"), you can type shortcut \\sup2 to insert superindex character \u00b2 . Another example: in chemical formulas, the number of atoms is often noted with a subindex number, e.g. \"CO\u2082\". To insert character \u2082 , type shortcut \\sub2 . In order to insert a non-breaking space, type \\nbsp : the auto-completer will propose to insert the character from the autotext list. Running concordance searches \u00b6 A concordance search allows you to find words and expressions in the translation memory and the glossary.

A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags: standalone tags and paired tags or double tags: Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text.

Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). !!! danger \"Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757\" \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. !!! Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name . Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name . For example: !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

In OmegaT, those inline codes are handled as tags . For example, part of the source text could be, say, underlined (e.g. the word \"after\" below): I came to this school after the start of this school year. The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags: standalone tags and paired tags or double tags: Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text. For example, here the paired tags represent some formatting that applies to the word \"after\" and its translation \"apr\u00e8s\".

When the source text contains one or more standalone tags , you must insert them in the translation in a position that is equivalent to their position in the source text. In the following example, the standalone tag represents a text entry field where the respondent will have to select a number: <x1/> hours > <x1/> heures Inserting tags \u00b6 Before inserting tags you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment.

See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you follow the three steps above precisely. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : Warning Remember that you can't create an alternative translation if the segment already has an alternative translation. See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation. To do that, follow these simple steps: Go to the segment where you want to restore the default translation Press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to select the whole target text Press the Del on your keyboard to delete the translation Press Ctrl + S to save (or leave the segment) to restore the default translation", "title": "Repetitions"}, {"location": "ru/adaptation/repetitions/#handling-repetitions", "text": "Some segments may be repeated in the project.

The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags : standalone tags and paired tags or double tags : Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you follow the three steps above precisely. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : Warning Remember that you can't create an alternative translation if the segment already has an alternative translation. See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation. To do that, follow these simple steps: Go to the segment where you want to restore the default translation Press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to select the whole target text Press the Del on your keyboard to delete the translation Press Ctrl + S to save (or leave the segment) to restore the default translation", "title": "Repetitions"}, {"location": "ru/editing/repetitions/#handling-repetitions", "text": "Some segments may be repeated in the project.

The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags : standalone tags and paired tags or double tags : Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text.

Target text reads Le dioxyde de carbone (CO2) se dissout dans l'eau de mer pour former de l'acide carbonique. Delete number 2 in \u201cCO2\u201d (and keep the cursor right after \"CO\"). A subscript number should be used instead of a regular digit. In that same position, type the autotext shortcut \\sub2 Notice how the auto-completer window opens showing the autotext entry. Press Enter to insert the special character \u2082 . The result should be: CO\u2082 In this exercise you have used an autotext shortcut that you knew already. In the following exercises you'll find out an autotext entry that you don't know. Exercise 07.2: find special character in the list of autotext entries \u00b6 In this exercise, you must insert the multiplication symbol but you don't know what autotext entry you can use. Go to segment #74 Source text reads: Thermal conductivity coefficient <br/>(W/m \u00d7 K) Open the list of available shortcuts here . Look for the autotext entry for the multiplication symbol. You can use either \\times or \\x (how lucky, this one is shorter!) Translate segment #74 as you like (don't forget the part in parentheses). To translate the part in parenthesis, type \\x (or \\times ) between W/m and K . Notice how the auto-completer opens when you typed the autotext shortcut. Press Enter to insert the caracter. Result should be: W/m \u00d7 K Incorrect translation: W/m x K Info You can find the list of autotext entries in OmegaT guides > Miscellanea > Autotext Exercise 07.3: insert special character from the character table \u00b6 Remember the auto-completer? You used it to insert tags. You'll use it again now to insert a special character. Go to segment #75 Target text reads: \u201cLa densit\u00e9 de population est de 62 personnes par km2 en 2023.\u201d Delete number 2 in \u201ckm2\u201d (and keep your cursor right after \u201ckm\u201d). Press Ctrl + Space several times to cycle through all the sections in the auto-completer. Stop when you reach the \u201cCharacter table\u201d. Spot the relevant character \u00b2 and double click on it to insert it. The result should be: km\u00b2 Tip You could have inserted character \u00b2 with shortcut \\sup2 (where \"suP\" stands for superscript or superindex or superordinate). Exercise 07.4: insert special quotation marks \u00b6 French uses special quotation marks, called angle quotes or \"chevrons\". You can use autotext to insert them. Go to segment #77.

That applies to text in any language except languages written in a right-to-left (RTL) script, like Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, etc., in which case the segment flows from right to left (RTL) and is aligned to the right. Global text direction and alignment of source and target segments is determined by the source and target languages, respectively, indicated in the project settings. Depending on the language, segments are aligned either to the left or to the right. On the other hand, while text direction at the segment level is determined by the project settings, text direction might change inside the segment depending on the script used. For example, English text in a LTR segment will flow left to right but a quotation in Arabic in that same segment will flow right to left. Since OmegaT users are only responsible for producing the translation, let\u2019s focus on what happens in target segments. Everything that follows applies to source segments too, with the difference that they are not directly editable in the translation editor in OmegaT. Bidirectionality mode \u00b6 The bidirectionality mode activates either when at least one of the two languages in the project uses a RTL script or when some text in a RTL is inserted. When the bidirectionality mode is activated, text direction is indicated by a flag on the top of the cursor. In the image below, notice how by default the cursor flag points left in a RTL segment but it may point left or right depending on the previous character: In text written in an LTR script, text flows from left to right, which means that the cursor flag points right and every character typed in LTR script always appears to the right of the previous one. That is always the case for the whole LTR segment unless it contains some fragment in an RTL script, in which case the rules for RTL text apply within that fragment. Strong and weak directionality \u00b6 In text written in an RTL script, text flows from right to left or left to right depending on the characters typed. Alphabetic characters have a RTL directionality: after each alphabetical character, the cursor flag points left, which means that if a new character is inserted, it will appear to the left of the cursor. On the other hand, numeric characters have a LTR directionality: after each number, the cursor flag points right, which means that if a new number is inserted, it will appear to the right of the cursor. Strings in LTR script will behave like numbers. Letters and numbers have a strong directionality, which means that they always flow in the same direction: letters in RTL script flow from right to left, letters in LTR flow from left to right, and numbers in any script always flow from left to right too. However, other characters like punctuation symbols do not have an intrinsic directionality of their own and will inherit the directionality of the segment (hence called of weak or neutral directionality): one same character (e.g. +, as in the image above) will flow right to left in a RTL segment, whereas it will flow left to right in a LTR segment. Orientation \u00b6 Some characters, such as quotation marks, are purely bidirectional and may also have a different orientation depending on the directionality of the segment. For example, the opening double angle quotation mark (Unicode U+00AB) points left when used in a LTR segment, but the same character points right when used in a RTL segment. In the image below, an autotext entry is used to insert that character in an LTR segment: In the image below, in turn, the same autotext entry is used to insert the same character in a LTR segment: The same thing would happen with any other double characters with neutral directionality, such as parenthesis, square brackets, curly brackets, etc. The opening character will point left or right depending on the directionality of the text stretch where it is inserted. Bidirectionality control characters \u00b6 Often the default behaviour described above is fine, but when you\u2019re mixing RTL text and LTR text or using special characters with weak directionality in RTL, you might need to use Unicode bidirectionality control characters (or bidi characters for short) to achieve the expected directionality. Bidi control characters can be found in the menu Edit > Insert Unicode Control Characters and may be used to: insert an invisible character with a certain strong directionality to force a specific position for a character with weak directionality create an embedding which works as a sort of protective environment within which text can flow in the opposite direction of the segment. These control characters are invisible, nothing is display or printed, but they change directionality. If you want to see where these characters are inserted, you can activate option View > Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters . Marks \u00b6 Let\u2019s see a few examples. Some expressions and brand names combine symbols with letters, e.g. Yahoo!, C++, C#, Hola!, Chips Ahoy!, etc. If you must write, say, \u201cC++\u201d in Arabic, you will notice that by default the + characters will appear to the left of the letter C: That is obviously incorrect. To force the correct position of the ++ characters, type C, then ++, then insert a left-to-right mark (or LRM for short) at the end. The ++ part will then be surrounded by two characters with strong LTR directionality (namely, the letter C and the LRM) and therefore will inherit the directionality of those characters and flow left to right instead of inheriting the directionality of the segment and flow right to left. See that in action in the following image: You might be tempted to type characters in reverse order: first ++, then C. Even though that might look good, that is logically wrong and could bring about issues when the text is further processed later or subjected to different uses. For example, if you type ++C in Arabic, even if it looks visually correct in the translation editor, it will not appear in search results when a user looks for \u201cC++\u201d in the Arabic document. Let alone the fact that often, if the expression is a bit complex, you\u2019ll struggle with trial and error until you obtain something that (only) looks as expected (although underneath it is wrong). Don\u2019t try to fake the looks. LRM and RLM (marks) characters are enough when you must change the directionality and position of one character only at the end or beginning of one homogeneous chunk of text. However, when the expression that must flow in the opposite direction contains several parts separated by spaces, or contains non-alphanumeric characters as well as alphanumeric characters, it\u2019s often better to use RTL or LTR embeddings. Embeddings \u00b6 The behaviour of embeddings is a bit different from that of marks. For starters, two characters must be inserted: one to start the embedding and another one to pop out of it. For example, to create a LTR embedding in an RTL segment, you would insert a left-to-right embedding (LRE) character, then the LTR text, then the pop directional formatting (PDF) character. Likewise, to create a RTL embedding in an LTR segment, you would insert a right-to-left embedding (RLE) character, then the RTL text, then the PDF character. Let\u2019s see an example. Equations, formulas and mathematical notation in general are expressions that must normally run left-to-right in bidirectional languages like Arabic or Hebrew, just like in English. Simply typing or copy-pasting an equation in Arabic will not produce the correct result, as can be seen in the image below: Instead, you should proceed in this way to create a LTR embedding: insert the LRE character, then type or insert the equation, finally insert the PDF character. See that in action: Notice how the red square rim appears around the LTR embedding right after inserting the PDF character, when the option Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters is activated in the View menu.", "title": "Bidi"}, {"location": "ru/misc/bidi/#handling-bidirectionality-in-omegat", "text": "", "title": "Handling bidirectionality in OmegaT"}, {"location": "ru/misc/bidi/#text-direction-and-text-alignment", "text": "By default, text direction in the translation editor is left to right (LTR) and text is aligned to the left. That applies to text in any language except languages written in a right-to-left (RTL) script, like Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, etc., in which case the segment flows from right to left (RTL) and is aligned to the right. Global text direction and alignment of source and target segments is determined by the source and target languages, respectively, indicated in the project settings. Depending on the language, segments are aligned either to the left or to the right. On the other hand, while text direction at the segment level is determined by the project settings, text direction might change inside the segment depending on the script used. For example, English text in a LTR segment will flow left to right but a quotation in Arabic in that same segment will flow right to left. Since OmegaT users are only responsible for producing the translation, let\u2019s focus on what happens in target segments.

In the image below, notice how by default the cursor flag points left in a RTL segment but it may point left or right depending on the previous character: In text written in an LTR script, text flows from left to right, which means that the cursor flag points right and every character typed in LTR script always appears to the right of the previous one.

Alphabetic characters have a RTL directionality: after each alphabetical character, the cursor flag points left, which means that if a new character is inserted, it will appear to the left of the cursor. On the other hand, numeric characters have a LTR directionality: after each number, the cursor flag points right, which means that if a new number is inserted, it will appear to the right of the cursor. Strings in LTR script will behave like numbers. Letters and numbers have a strong directionality, which means that they always flow in the same direction: letters in RTL script flow from right to left, letters in LTR flow from left to right, and numbers in any script always flow from left to right too. However, other characters like punctuation symbols do not have an intrinsic directionality of their own and will inherit the directionality of the segment (hence called of weak or neutral directionality): one same character (e.g. +, as in the image above) will flow right to left in a RTL segment, whereas it will flow left to right in a LTR segment.", "title": "Strong and weak directionality"}, {"location": "ru/misc/bidi/#orientation", "text": "Some characters, such as quotation marks, are purely bidirectional and may also have a different orientation depending on the directionality of the segment. For example, the opening double angle quotation mark (Unicode U+00AB) points left when used in a LTR segment, but the same character points right when used in a RTL segment. In the image below, an autotext entry is used to insert that character in an LTR segment: In the image below, in turn, the same autotext entry is used to insert the same character in a LTR segment: The same thing would happen with any other double characters with neutral directionality, such as parenthesis, square brackets, curly brackets, etc. The opening character will point left or right depending on the directionality of the text stretch where it is inserted.", "title": "Orientation"}, {"location": "ru/misc/bidi/#bidirectionality-control-characters", "text": "Often the default behaviour described above is fine, but when you\u2019re mixing RTL text and LTR text or using special characters with weak directionality in RTL, you might need to use Unicode bidirectionality control characters (or bidi characters for short) to achieve the expected directionality. Bidi control characters can be found in the menu Edit > Insert Unicode Control Characters and may be used to: insert an invisible character with a certain strong directionality to force a specific position for a character with weak directionality create an embedding which works as a sort of protective environment within which text can flow in the opposite direction of the segment. These control characters are invisible, nothing is display or printed, but they change directionality. If you want to see where these characters are inserted, you can activate option View > Mark Bidirectional Algorithm Control Characters .", "title": "Bidirectionality control characters"}, {"location": "ru/misc/bidi/#marks", "text": "Let\u2019s see a few examples. Some expressions and brand names combine symbols with letters, e.g. Yahoo!, C++, C#, Hola!, Chips Ahoy!, etc. If you must write, say, \u201cC++\u201d in Arabic, you will notice that by default the + characters will appear to the left of the letter C: That is obviously incorrect. To force the correct position of the ++ characters, type C, then ++, then insert a left-to-right mark (or LRM for short) at the end. The ++ part will then be surrounded by two characters with strong LTR directionality (namely, the letter C and the LRM) and therefore will inherit the directionality of those characters and flow left to right instead of inheriting the directionality of the segment and flow right to left. See that in action in the following image: You might be tempted to type characters in reverse order: first ++, then C. Even though that might look good, that is logically wrong and could bring about issues when the text is further processed later or subjected to different uses. For example, if you type ++C in Arabic, even if it looks visually correct in the translation editor, it will not appear in search results when a user looks for \u201cC++\u201d in the Arabic document. Let alone the fact that often, if the expression is a bit complex, you\u2019ll struggle with trial and error until you obtain something that (only) looks as expected (although underneath it is wrong). Don\u2019t try to fake the looks. LRM and RLM (marks) characters are enough when you must change the directionality and position of one character only at the end or beginning of one homogeneous chunk of text. However, when the expression that must flow in the opposite direction contains several parts separated by spaces, or contains non-alphanumeric characters as well as alphanumeric characters, it\u2019s often better to use RTL or LTR embeddings.", "title": "Marks"}, {"location": "ru/misc/bidi/#embeddings", "text": "The behaviour of embeddings is a bit different from that of marks.

Java maintenance \u00b6 OmegaT is developed in Java and needs JRE to run. The OmegaT installers we recommend include the version of JRE that OmegaT needs, and that JRE would be uninstalled when OmegaT is uninstalled. However, in any case, as Java can be a security risk if it\u2019s not kept up to date, it\u2019s worth maintaining that version of JRE up to date after installed if necessary. Data leakage \u00b6 OmegaT can check for new versions, get MT results, get glossary matches from TaaS, download MediaWiki links and use them as source files, have remote files on HTTP, Git and SVN servers mapped locally, and then there's SVN/Git team project functionality. We're not using any of those functions in the translation of the PISA/PIAAC materials, which means we won't instruct users to configure or use them.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

In OmegaT, those inline codes are handled as tags . For example, part of the source text could be, say, underlined (e.g. the word \"after\" below): I came to this school after the start of this school year. The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags : standalone tags and paired tags or double tags : Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text. For example, here the paired tags represent some formatting that applies to the word \"after\" and its translation \"apr\u00e8s\". I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. Je suis venu \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole <g1> apr\u00e8s </g1> le d\u00e9but de cette ann\u00e9e scolaire. When the source text contains one or more standalone tags , you must insert them in the translation in a position that is equivalent to their position in the source text. In the following example, the standalone tag represents a text entry field where the respondent will have to select a number: <x1/> hours > <x1/> heures Inserting tags \u00b6 Before inserting tags you must know whether it is a standalone tag or two paired tags . To insert paired tags in your translation, proceed as follows: Translate the segment. Select the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted part in the source text. Press Ctrl + Space to launch the auto-completer. In the tags section of the auto-completer, select the paired tags you want to insert. Info The auto-completer has several sections, so if you don't see the tags section straight-away, just press Ctrl + Space again to cycle through the auto-completer until you see it. To insert a standalone tag , proceed as follows: Click on the position where you want to insert the tag (before, after or while translating). Press Ctrl + Space to launch the auto-completer. In the tags section of the auto-completer, select the standalone tag you want to insert. You can also insert a tag one by one with shortcut Ctrl + T . The following video shows how to handle tags , enjoy : Fixing tag issues \u00b6 All tags you see in the source text should be present in the translation too and in the correct position. You must correct any errors that you may see when that's not the case. You may find two types of issue: A tag or tag pair is missing: in that case, the solution is simply to insert it . A tag is inserted but misplaced: the solution may be either to drag and drop single tags to the correct position, or simply to delete the tag (or tag pair) and insert it again correctly.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you follow the three steps above precisely. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : Warning Remember that you can't create an alternative translation if the segment already has an alternative translation. See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation. To do that, follow these simple steps: Go to the segment where you want to restore the default translation Press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to select the whole target text Press the Del on your keyboard to delete the translation Press Ctrl + S to save (or leave the segment) to restore the default translation", "title": "Repetitions"}, {"location": "ru/review/repetitions/#handling-repetitions", "text": "Some segments may be repeated in the project.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you follow the three steps above precisely. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : Warning Remember that you can't create an alternative translation if the segment already has an alternative translation. See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation. To do that, follow these simple steps: Go to the segment where you want to restore the default translation Press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to select the whole target text Press the Del on your keyboard to delete the translation Press Ctrl + S to save (or leave the segment) to restore the default translation", "title": "Repetitions"}, {"location": "ru/translation/repetitions/#handling-repetitions", "text": "Some segments may be repeated in the project.

The segment in OmegaT will look like this (notice the paired tags enclosing the word \"after\"): I came to this school <g1> after </g1> the start of this school year. You will recognize tags because they are in red font . Hover over a tag if you want to see what it stands for. A tooltip will show the original inline code: Types of tags \u00b6 There are two types of tags : standalone tags and paired tags or double tags : Standalone tags : a single tag (e.g. <x1/> ) which stands for some element that appears at that position, such as a line break, an image, an input field, etc. Paired tags are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag (e.g. <g2> and </g2> ) and affect the text between them. You can see that two tags are paired when they have the same number. When the source text contains paired tags around a word or expression, you must insert the same paired tags around the part of the translation that corresponds to the formatted word or expression in the source text.

We provide some tips here . Accessing a new project \u00b6 There are two ways you may access a project for the first time, depending on whether it is an online project (or team project ) or an offline project . If you must work on an offline project , you will receive a new OmegaT project package (aka an OMT package, or a file with .omt extension). Go to the section Unpacking an offline project below to see what you must do to unpack a project package. If you must work on an online project (or team project ), you will receive the URL to the repository where the OmegaT project is hosted. Go to the section Downloading a team project below to see what you must to do download a team project from a repository. If you're not sure whether your project is online or offline, it's very easy: if you receive an OMT package, the project is offline, and if you receive a URL to a git repository, the project is online. You receive Project is OMT file offline/package URL to git repo online/team Caution Unpacking or downloading an OmegaT project (depending on the distribution mode) needs to be done only once for each project. After you have unpacked or downloaded a project, you can simply re-open it from the list of recent projects . Unpacking an offline project \u00b6 If you receive an OMT package, you must unpack the project (from the OMT package) to access the project for the first time. To unpack a project, follow these steps: Store the OMT package in the folder where you would like to create the OmegaT project. To unpack the project from the OMT package: Launch OmegaT. Go to Project > Unpack project from OMT file : Navigate to the location where you stored the OMT package. Select the OMT package and click on Open: A pop up opens. Click Yes . You can now perform your task in the project. Downloading a team project \u00b6 If you receive a URL to a git repository, you must download the team project from that repository to access the project for the first time. Info The URL should look a bit like this: https://domain.com/path/to/repo-name.git . Authentication \u00b6 At some point during the steps below, or afterwards, OmegaT will ask you to authenticate, so please make sure you have your credentials at hand. OmegaT might ask you to authenticate one or more times (depending on the project settings), please just enter the same credentials as many time as requested. How to download the project from the repository \u00b6 To download the team project, follow these steps: Define a location in your machine where you would like to create the OmegaT project. We recommend a Work folder (or whatever you prefer to call it) in your user's home directory. Let's assume path C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\ (for user USER ). Danger \u2757\u2757\u2757 \ud83d\udc80 Make sure that location is NOT inside a sync'ed folder such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Syncthing or the like, or in a server or a network drive. Copy the URL of the project repository to your clipboard (select it and press Ctrl + C or right-click it and select Copy). In OmegaT, go to Project > Download Team Project . In the Download Team Project dialog, click in the Repository URL field and then press Ctrl + V to paste the URL from your clipboard. Click in the New Local Project Folder field. OmegaT will propose a path to the location where it will create the project folder. Please wait until you see that path. Failure DO NOT click on the ... button. See the three steps above in the following animation: You might want to modify that path to create the folder in the location that you have defined in the first step above. For example: + By default, it's likely that OmegaT proposes to create the project inside your home directory, e.g. `C:\\Users\\USER\\repo-name`. + Modify that path so that it points ot the actual location you prefer, e.g. if you follow our recommendation above, that would be `C:\\Users\\USER\\Work\\repo-name`. For example: ![](../_img/omt-download-team-proj-edit-local-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between every two folders in your path. <!-- To do that: + Copy the path to the location where you want to create the project, e.g. `C:/Work/`. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-copy-path.gif) + Then, in the **New Local Project Folder** field, select the part of the path up to the slash before the project folder and delete it. + Then, press ++ctrl+v++ to paste your path in replacement of the deleted part. ![](../_img/download-git-dialog-update-path.gif) !!! Caution Make sure there's a slash between the path that you paste and the project folder name. --> Closing the project \u00b6 When you are done working for the day, quit OmegaT ( Ctrl + Q ). Re-opening an existing project \u00b6 After you have received and opened a project for the first time, the project exists in your machine and OmegaT will remember it. The next times you want to access the project in OmegaT, go to Project > Open Recent Project . The project you were working on will appear in the list: Note Make sure the disctinction between opening a recent project and downloading or unpacking a new project (depending on the distribution mode) is clear.

By default, the translation of a repeated segment is autopropagated to all its instances. Identifying repeated segments \u00b6 You can recognize that you are in a repeated segment because the Segment Properties pane will show a field called Is duplicate (with value FIRST for the first repetitions and value NEXT for any others). Also, the segment number also includes how many more repetitions the active segment has. Also, repeated segments from the second instance onwards have grey font, which could help you realize they are instances of a repeated segment. If you right click on a repeated segment, the contextual menu will list all the other instances. It can be useful to jump to them (by clicking on one of them from the contextual menu) to see the different contexts in which that repeated segment appears in the project. Autopropagation \u00b6 When you edit the translation of a repeated segment, as soon as the edit is saved the changes will be automatically reflected in all the repetitions in the project. Creating alternative translation \u00b6 In some cases, two instances of a repeated segment might need to be translated differently in different contexts. In that situation, you may want to modify the translation of only one of the repetitions without altering the rest. In other words, you must create an alternative translation to prevent auto-propagating your update. To create an alternative translation : Right click on the segment and choose Create Alternative Translation from the contextual menu. Edit the translation of the active segment. Press Ctrl + S to register the alternative translation. The Multiple Translations pane will show the different translations. And here's a quick summary: Danger Alternative translations may be treacherous if not applied correctly. Make sure you follow the three steps above precisely. The following video shows how to create alternative translations, enjoy : Warning Remember that you can't create an alternative translation if the segment already has an alternative translation. See the section below to learn how you can recognize an alternative translation. If you must modify an existing alternative translation, simply edit the target text and save ( Ctrl + S ). Identifying alternative translations \u00b6 Here's how you can recognize whether a segment has an alternative translation. On the one hand, if a segment has an alternative translation, the Segment properties pane will show a property called Is alternative with value true . That field will flash in orange when you active the segment or when you save the project while that segment is active. On the other hand, you will notice that the Multiple translations pane shows that translation and the context properties that the alternative translation binds too (typically the file name and some identifier, e.g. the segment ID or a key). Finally, and most eloquent, you can see that the segment has an alternative translation if the Create Alternative Translation item in the segment's contextual menu (or the Edit menu) is grayed out and cannot be selected. Restoring the default translation \u00b6 If for some reason an existing alternative translation is unnecessary and you would like to restore auto-propagation into that segment, the simplest way is to just delete the alternative translation. To do that, follow these simple steps: Go to the segment where you want to restore the default translation Press Ctrl + A on your keyboard to select the whole target text Press the Del on your keyboard to delete the translation Press Ctrl + S to save (or leave the segment) to restore the default translation", "title": "Repetitions"}, {"location": "ru/verification/repetitions/#handling-repetitions", "text": "Some segments may be repeated in the project.
